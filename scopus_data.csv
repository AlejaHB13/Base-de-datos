If optimally managed and operated, DERs could provide flexibility and highly valuable grid services such as restoration, peak shaving, voltage regulation, and frequency support to maintain grid reliability. Different applications and enterprises, such as distributed energy resources management systems (DERMS), are being developed for coordinated and optimal operation of DERs. However, to attract sufficient DER participation and achieve the coordinated operation of DERs, systems and components must be interoperable and information exchange must be secure. Along this line, the Portland State University power engineering group is developing Energy Grid of Things (EGoT) DERMS prototype. The proposed application requires the coordinated dispatch of large numbers of DERs and testing such a system presents a challenge; it is not practical to test system prototypes using thousands of real DERs. Hence, the modeling environment (ME) is designed as a co-simulation tool to model interactions between a DERMS and a mass of simulated DERs. The ME is expected to address the scalability issue inherent to hardware-in-the-loop DERMS simulation; many assets are needed to observe effects on the grid from deployment and dispatch of DERs. To enable the development and testing of such advanced applications for power distribution system planning and operations, the U.S Department of Energy developed GridAPPS-D™, an open-source, standards-based platform at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This paper introduces the proposed ME for testing a DERMS application. The architecture of the ME is presented, and the GridAPPS-D features for a such simulation environment are discussed. Additionally, the procedure for developing the ME within the GridAPPS-D platform and use of different APIs for efficient and timely integration are discussed in detail.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Interoperability; Open source software; Common information model; Coordinated operation; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy resource managements; Grid services; Information Modeling; Modeling environments; Power systems simulation; Resource management systems; System prototype; Voltage regulators","Common information model; distributed energy resources; grid services; power system simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135219121"

Visualization applications have historically embedded custom-written renderers to enable them to provide the necessary combination of features, performance, and visual fidelity required by their users. As computing power, rendering algorithms, dedicated rendering hardware acceleration operations, and associated low-level APIs have advanced, the effort and costs associated with maintaining renderers within visualization applications have risen dramatically. The rising cost and complexity associated with renderer development creates an undesirable barrier for visualization applications to be able to fully benefit from the latest rendering methods and hardware. ANARI directly addresses these challenges by providing a high-level, visualization-oriented API that abstracts low-level rendering algorithms and hardware acceleration details while providing easy and efficient access to diverse ANARI implementations, thereby enabling visualization applications to support the state-of-the-art rendering capabilities. © 1999-2011 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer hardware; Lighting; Rendering (computer graphics); Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3-D rendering; Complexity theory; Hardware; Hardware acceleration; Rendering (computer graphic); Rendering algorithms; Rendering hardware; Software; State of the art; Visualization application; Ray tracing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127499076"

The adopted solution implemented the following security features: open authorization, multi-factor authentication, identity brokering, and user management to safeguard microservice APIs. Then, we extended the security solution with a virtual private network (VPN), Blowfish and crypt (Bcrypt) hash, encryption method, API key, network firewall, and secure socket layer (SSL) to build up a digital infrastructure. To accomplish and describe the adopted SSK solution, we utilized a web engineering security method. As a case study, we designed and developed an electronic health coaching (eCoach) prototype system and hosted the system in the expanded digital secure infrastructure to collect and exchange personal health data over microservice APIs. We further described our adopted security solution’s procedural, technical, and practical considerations. We validated our SSK solution implementation by theoretical evaluation and experimental testing. We have compared the test outcomes with related studies qualitatively to determine the efficacy of the hybrid security solution in digital infrastructure. The SSK implementation and configuration in the eCoach prototype system has effectively secured its microservice APIs from an attack in all the considered scenarios with 100% accuracy. The developed digital infrastructure with SSK solution efficiently sustained a load of (≈)300 concurrent users. In addition, we have performed a qualitative comparison among the following security solutions: Spring-based security, Keycloak-based security, and their combination (our utilized hybrid security solution), where SSK showed a promising outcome. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, an ultralight geometry processing library is developed to resolve this issue effectively and efficiently. Here, we say the kernel is ultralight because it has a very small set of data-structures and algorithms by comparison with industrial-level geometry kernels. Within the library, a simplified surface boundary representation (B-rep) and a radial edge structure are developed respectively to depict the geometry model and the surface mesh, plus hash tables that record the connections between the geometry model and the surface mesh. Based on these data structures, a set of efficient algorithms are developed, which initializes the connection tables, projects a point back to the original geometry, etc. With these data-structure and algorithmic infrastructures set up, the callings of eight well-designed Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are powerful enough to enable the parallel mesh refinement algorithm outputs a mesh respecting the input CAD model accurately. Numerical experiments will be finally presented to evaluate the performance of the overall parallel mesh refinement algorithm and the algorithms in relation with the developed library. © 2022, The Author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Data structures; Mesh generation; Boundary representation; Boundary representations; Computer aided design models; Computer-aided design; Geometry model; Geometry processing; Mesh deformation; Mesh refinement; Parallel mesh refinement; Ultra-light; Computer aided design","Boundary representation (B-rep); Computer-aided design (CAD); Mesh deformation; Mesh generation; Mesh refinement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127289019"

Motivated by this problem, this paper presents a transpilation approach based on inductive program synthesis for modernizing existing code. Our method is based on the observation that the overwhelming majority of source/target programs in this setting satisfy an assumption that we call trace-compatibility: not only do the programs share syntactically identical low-level expressions, but these expressions also take the same values in corresponding execution traces. Our method leverages this observation to design a new neural-guided synthesis algorithm that (1) uses a novel neural architecture called cognate grammar network (CGN) and (2) leverages a form of concolic execution to prune partial programs based on intermediate values that arise during a computation. We have implemented our approach in a tool called NGST2 and use it to translate imperative Java and Python code to functional variants that use the Stream and functools APIs respectively. Our experiments show that NGST2 significantly outperforms several baselines and that our proposed neural architecture and pruning techniques are vital for achieving good results.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Functional programming; High level languages; Java programming language; Network architecture; Network coding; Neural networks; Call traces; Execution trace; Functional codes; Inductive Program Synthesis; Neural architectures; Neural-networks; Parallelizations; Performance; Program synthesis; Transpilation; Python","neural networks; program synthesis; transpilation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129720072"

The framework targets human programmable interfaces and human-machine interfaces, which can be used by people with little or no programming experience. The framework follows a meta-programming approach by enabling users to program cobots by voice in addition to using a mouse, tablet, or keyboard. Upon a voice instruction, the framework automates the manual tasks required to manipulate the vendor-provided interfaces. The main advantages of this approach are simplified, guided programming, which only requires the knowledge of 5–10 voice instructions; increased programming speed compared to the manual approach; and the possibility of sharing programs as videos. The approach is generalized to other kinds of robots and robot programming tools using so-called meta-controllers, which leverage the power of graphical user interface automation tools and techniques. © 2022 The Author(s).

Its verification is a hard task due to its intrinsic tendency to correct errors. The generation and injection of millions of random inputs as well as the cross-checking of the corresponding outputs is highly recommended. Using HDL simulations for such work leads to prohibitive execution times. This letter proposes a verification strategy in which the software testbed is executed on a multi-core host and the hardware under verification is prototyped on a PCIe accelerator card. Data are transferred in big blocks of codewords over a high-bandwidth PCIe channel and applied to the decoder using a pipeline management to maximize the use of computational resources and to minimize the verification time. The decoder is replicated with parallel access to DDRs. OpenMP is used to leverage the parallel capabilities of the host and OpenCL, together with Xilinx Runtime Library (XRT), to manage the PCIe FPGA card execution. The results show an important speed-up with respect to HDL simulation and to other prototyping approaches.

This article focuses on the energy-efficient vehicle routing problem, given the relationship between a vehicle's energy consumption and CO2 emission. Extensive studies have established the energy dissipation model considering road gradients, traffic flow, and road congestion, and the route searching process entails algorithm application. However, despite the efforts to overcome the trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality, the probabilistic and randomized-based routing algorithms would be trapped into the local optima or compromise computational efficiency. Hence, this article aims to propose an efficient vehicle routing algorithm in the sustainable transportation domain. The method derives a Pareto-optimal solution in an acceptable execution time; furthermore, the embedded cost function includes energy dissipation and recuperation mechanism in hilly regions. For a real-world application, this article refers to road gradients and a real-time traffic API. The findings showed the amelioration of CO2 emissions and computational loads, thus corroborating the pragmatic aspect. The eco-oriented route decision connotes a practical foundation of sustainability and contributes to future studies in this promising field. © 2022","Application programming interfaces (API); Carbon dioxide; Computational efficiency; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heuristic algorithms; Motor transportation; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Roads and streets; Routing algorithms; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; CO2 emissions; ECO routing; Efficient eco-routing algorithm; Real-time traffic flow; Realtime traffic; Road gradients; Sustainable transportation; Traffic flow; Vehicle energy consumption; Vehicle Routing Problems; algorithm; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; computer simulation; greenhouse gas; sustainability; sustainable development; Cost functions","efficient eco-routing algorithm; real-time traffic flow; sustainable transportation; vehicle energy consumption","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123009515"

Today numerous gadgets support the use of Mixed Reality / Augmented Reality (AR)/ Virtual Reality. The Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) like that of Hololens, Google Lens, Jio Glass manifested reality into virtuality. Other than the HMDs many organizations tend to develop mobile AR applications to support umpteen number of industries like medicine, education, construction. Currently, the major issue lies in the performance parameters of these applications, while deploying for mobile application’s graphics performance, latency, and CPU functioning. Many industries pose real-time computation requirements in AR but do not implement an efficient algorithm in their frameworks. Offloading the computation of deep learning models involved in the application to the cloud servers will highly affect the processing parameters. For our use case, we will be using Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) which is a modern tool for face detection, using a 3-stage neural network detector. Therefore, the optimization of communication between local application and cloud computing frameworks needs to be optimized. The proposed framework defines how the parameters involving the complete deployment of a mobile AR application can be optimized in terms of retrieval of multimedia, its processing, and augmentation of graphics, eventually enhancing the performance. To implement the proposed algorithm a mobile application is created in Unity3D. The mobile application virtually augments a 3D model of a skeleton on a target face. After the mentioned experimentation, it is found that average Media Retrieval Time (1.1471 μ s) and Client Time (1.1207 μ s) in the local application are extremely low than the average API process time (288.934ms). The highest time latency is achieved at the frame rate higher than 80fps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","3D modeling; Application programming interfaces (API); computation offloading; Computational efficiency; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Face recognition; Helmet mounted displays; Learning systems; Mixed reality; Mobile computing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Augmented reality applications; Cloud computation; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Latency; Media retrieval; Medical augmented realities; Multi tasks; Multi-task cascaded convolutional neural network; Offloading; Augmented reality","Augmented reality; Cloud computation; Deep learning; Latency; Media retrieval; Medical augmented reality; MTCNN; OffLoading","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135533845"

Based on the digital nonlinear random matrix theory, this paper constructs a three-dimensional design platform for virtual ethnic clothing and proposes a weighted graph tree representation method for the deviation transfer process of nonlinear ethnic clothing. The model first analyzes the business links and information related to the deviation transfer modeling of ethnic clothing and establishes a hierarchical relationship tree, a method of expressing the order of ethnic clothing, and a method of expressing deviation. The weighted graph tree model and construction rules of the deviation transmission process realize the integrated expression of the deviation transmission information of ethnic clothing and solve the nonlinear problem in the transmission of ethnic clothing deviation.

This AI-Edge platform provides developers with a whole deep learning development environment to set up their deep learning life cycle processes, such as model training, model evaluation, model deployment, model inference, ground truth collecting, data pre-processing, and training data management. To the best of our knowledge, such a whole deep learning development environment has not been built before. MiniDeep uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the backend platform of a deep learning tuning management model. In the edge device, the OpenVino enables deep learning inference acceleration at the edge. To perform a deep learning life cycle job, MiniDeep proposes a mini deep life cycle (MDLC) system which is composed of several microservices from the cloud to the edge. MiniDeep provides Train Job Creator (TJC) for training dataset management and the models’ training schedule and Model Packager (MP) for model package management. All of them are based on several AWS cloud services. On the edge device, MiniDeep provides Inference Handler (IH) to handle deep learning inference by hosting RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) requests/responses from the end device. Data Provider (DP) is responsible for ground truth collection and dataset synchronization for the cloud. With the deep learning ability, this paper uses the MiniDeep platform to implement a recommendation system for AI-QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) KIOSK (interactive kiosk) application. AI-QSR uses the MiniDeep platform to train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)-based recommendation system. The LSTM-based recommendation system converts KIOSK UI (User Interface) flow to the flow sequence and performs sequential recommendations with food suggestions. At the end of this paper, the efficiency of the proposed MiniDeep is verified through real experiments. The experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed LSTM-based scheme performs better than the rule-based scheme in terms of purchase hit accuracy, categorical cross-entropy, precision, recall, and F1 score. © 2022 by the authors.","Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Software; Data handling; Edge computing; Information management; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Recommender systems; User interfaces; Web services; Amazon web services; Cloud-computing; Deep learning; Development environment; Edge computing; Ground truth; Learning platform; Minideep; Model training; Training model; artificial intelligence; software; Application programming interfaces (API)","cloud computing; deep learning; edge computing; MiniDeep; recommendation system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137134539"

It has been demonstrated that this process is an NP-hard problem. In mobile Apps development, it is often necessary to read confidential information, leading to the business privacy leakage of enterprises. Thus, we devise a novel efficient web APIs recommendation (E-WAR) approach based on locality-sensitive hashing for recommending desirable web APIs to developers.

WSs are provided to client application developers through web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as YouTube API, Twitter API, Facebook API, etc. Due to the popularity of WSs, the developers frequently discuss various WSs-based application' issues on online forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). This study aims to highlight the problems faced by client developers in the development process of WSs-based applications using the dataset of SO. The comprehension of developers' conversations on SO can give insight into the frequency, difficulty, and popularity of different WSs-related problems of developers. We downloaded 12,746 posts from SO relevant to WSs-related issues for this article. We used the topic modeling technique (LDA) to extract various topics from the SO dataset. The topics are labeled and organized into categories and sub-categories according to relationships among them. The difficulty and popularity of each topic have been analyzed. Our investigation yield several findings. First, developers focus on six topics related to WSs on SO: Client APIs development, Data Processing, Web services Authorization, Framework Support, Web APIs, and Mobile Applications. Secondly, the advantages and disadvantages of web applications topic (Fused_Popularity=0.39), from the Clients APIs development category have the highest prevalence, followed by Database (DB) and Data Processing in Applications topic (Fused_Popularity=0.38) from the Data Processing category. Third, most WSs-related topics in all categories are evolving promptly on SO, i.e., new questions are added daily about WSs development, deployment, and authorization. Fourth, the questions of type 'how' are primarily asked in Framework support, Client APIs development, and Web APIs categories. Although, many questions in other categories are of the kind 'What'. It is also observed that WSs developers not only used SO to ask How and What types of questions but they also used SO to ask information-seeking questions (i.e., in Data processing and Client APIs development categories). Fifth, the topics relevant to Web APIs (Fused_Popularity=10.8) and Client API Development ((Fused_Popularity=9.35) categories of WSs are very popular on SO. Sixth, the questions relevant to the Web APIs (Fused_Difficulty =3) & Client APIs development (Fused_Difficulty=2.25) categories are more difficult than the other four categories. The results of our research may be helpful for the following WSs stakeholders: WSs Client application developers, WSs Educators, and WSs researchers. The WSs Educators and investigators can get more knowledge of new methods and discover novel techniques to make challenging WSs topics easy to understand. WSs framework developers can utilize our extracted WSs topics and categories to know the preferences of WSs developers that may support them in upgrading existing frameworks or developing new ones. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Authorization; Computer systems programming; Data mining; Mobile computing; Social networking (online); Software design; Application problems; Applications programming interfaces; Client application problem; Client applications; Documentation; Mobile applications; Software development management; WEB application; Web application programming interface; Web applications; Webs services; Web services","client application problems; Client applications; web APIs; web services","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147263798"

The kinematic and energetic consistency principles are employed to link the atomistic and continuum scales. The Ni-based superalloys with different void defects are proposed, and the effect of various parameters is investigated to distinguish the proper atomistic RVE in the multiscale analysis. The dataset of stress-strain samples is generated using the molecular dynamics analysis under various loading conditions that is divided into several groups according to strain values by the K–means algorithm to enhance the regression accuracy, in which a feedforward neural network is trained for each group. In order to optimize the unknown parameters in neural networks, the Bayesian regularization approach is employed through the optimization process. The material properties of the coarse-scale domain required for the multiscale analysis, i.e., the stress tensor and tangent modulus, are then derived from the trained neural networks for each Gauss integration point.

In contrast to static, pre-recorded datasets that focus on the perception aspect of scene understanding, agency is a top priority in our work. We provide three levels of robot agency, allowing users to control a robot at varying levels of difficulty and realism. While the most basic level provides pre-defined trajectories and ground-truth localisation, the more realistic levels allow us to evaluate integrated behaviours comprising perception, navigation, exploration and SLAM. In contrast to existing simulation environments, we focus on robust scene understanding research using our environment interface (BenchBot) that provides a simple API for seamless transition between the simulated environments and real robotic platforms. We believe this scaffolded design is an effective approach to bridge the gap between classical static datasets without any agency and the unique challenges of robotic evaluation in reality.

However, the performance control form of musical water landscape generally adopts the manual offline preprogramming method, which needs to use the human subject's consciousness to perceive the style, emotion, and other advanced features of the music first and then choreographs the corresponding landscape performance, which is a high-cost design form and low usage rate of the landscape and is not conducive to the expansion of the music library. In this paper, we design and implement a musical water landscape simulation system using OpenGL and 3Dmax technology in combination with wireless music buzzer sensors, extract and analyze the music features based on this system, and study the system control of musical water landscape.

This technique is based on the development of a successful sub-program, which can link programming language of MATLAB with SAP2000 through the OAPI library. Therefore, the two-way data exchange between MATLAB and SAP2000 can be continuously secured, and the process of modification of the initial FE model in SAP2000 is implemented by coding instead of using the standard point-and-click procedure in SAP2000′s interface. The damage identification process in structures is then done using an optimization algorithm, named a modified version Cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, and called new balance of Cuckoo search (NB-CS). The key factor in NB-CS is to create a balance between two values: the best global and the worst global. To achieve this balance, NB-CS proposes two main contributions. The first is based on the modification of the concept of a random walk whose step lengths obey Lévy distribution. Whereas, the second is to establish a new balance vector, which is presented based on the global optimal and the worse optimal exploited at each iteration. This vector is combined with each step length to establish a new movement strategy, which is more flexible and more intelligent than that of the original CS. To examine NB-CS's reliability, the first 23 classical benchmark functions are selected to illustrate the convergence rate and level of accuracy of NB-CS compared to the original CS. To authenticate the efficiency of the proposed method, three models, including square shell structure, parabolic domes, and partial sphere shell structure, are investigated for different damage cases. NB-CS is then employed to minimize the objective function with design variables related to the extent and location of damage in thin-shell elements in the structures. The statistical results show the feasible performance of NB-CS in a widespread class of optimization problems and its great potential for application to structural damage identification. © 2022","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Benchmarking; Damage detection; Electronic data interchange; Finite element method; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Shape optimization; Shells (structures); Structural analysis; Cuckoo search algorithm, finite element model updating; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Damaged thin-shell structure; Finite-element model updating; Open application programming interface; Sap2000; Sap2000-open application programming interface; Structural damage identification; Thin shell structures; MATLAB","Cuckoo search algorithm, finite element model updating; Damaged thin-shell structures; SAP2000-OAPI; Structural damage identification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135684018"

ACM, New York, pp 353–369, https://doi.org/10.1145/2998181.2998220, 2017) and jazz musicians (Heckathorn and Jeffri in Poetics 28(4):307, 2001). Entities of such target population satisfy a property that is typically identified using an oracle (human or a pre-trained classifier). When the property of the target entities is not directly queryable via the API, we refer to the property as ‘hidden’ and the population as hidden population. Our objective in this paper is to sample such target populations that satisfy a certain property that can be verified by an oracle (typically a pre-trained classifier). However, the property itself cannot be a part of the query. We refer to such populations which are not directly queryable via the API as a hidden population. Finding individuals who belong to these populations on social networks is hard because they are non-queryable, and the sampler has to explore from a combinatorial query space within a finite budget limit. Further, limited API calls, a limited number of queryable attributes to explore from and an exponential query space to select a query from make the problem very challenging. To address the challenges, we model the search for hidden population search as a decision problem. By exploiting the correlation between queryable attributes and the population of interest and by hierarchically ordering the query space, we propose a decision-tree-based Thompson sampler (DT-TMP) that efficiently discovers the right combination of attributes to query. Additionally, DT-TMP alleviates the problem of exploring the exponentially large query space through a hierarchical ordering of the queries. Our proposed sampler outperforms the state-of-the-art samplers in online experiments, for example, by 54% in Twitter. When the number of matching entities to a query is known in offline experiments, DT-TMP performs exceedingly well by a factor of 0.9–1.5 × over the baseline samplers. In future, we wish to explore the option of finding hidden populations by formulating more complex queries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Budget control; Decision trees; Diseases; Social networking (online); Applications programming interfaces; Budget limits; Computer-supported cooperative works; Exponentials; Hidden population mining; Mental illness; Property; Thompson; Thompson samplings; Tree-based; Reinforcement learning","Decision tree; Hidden population mining; Reinforcement learning; Sampling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119077968"

The field of project cost relies on the significant advantages of BIM technology to realize the intelligence of project cost management. It can effectively promote the horizontal information collection and vertical information interaction of different participants, and achieve a good information exchange and interaction effect. This paper combines the characteristics of China nuclear power engineering projects, applies building information modeling (BIM) technology, and integrates it into the nuclear power engineering cost software framework. This paper firstly analyzes the basic characteristics of China nuclear power engineering cost software, and puts forward the key functional requirements for existing cost software. On this basis, the basic characteristics of foreign mainstream construction cost software with BIM technology and the feasibility of its application in China is also analyzed. The model consists of two parts, namely the BIM data management platform and the functional model of the construction project budget subsystem. Among them, the BIM data management platform realizes the analysis, storage and management of IFC (Industry Foundation Class) data, and provides a user interface for specific professional fields, such as the field of construction engineering budget, while the construction engineering budget subsystem provides users with cost budgeting expertise. In addition, this paper describes in detail the method of using BIM technology to create the most used pipe network model in cost assessment. Based on Revit software, combined with the use of visual programming tools Dynamo and Revit API, the repetitive and tedious manual modeling process is automated to compete the creation of the BIM model of a large number of pipe networks in a relatively short time, and make the model carry rich engineering information. This paper establishes a basic framework suitable for China nuclear power engineering cost software, which can lay the foundation for the subsequent development of corresponding software. The pipeline network BIM establishment method proposed in this paper can greatly improve the work efficiency of traditional CAD modeling, realize seamless connection with cost assessment, and has broad engineering application prospects.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

Prior BIM research has primarily focused on permanent building components; temporary structures such as scaffolding and concrete formwork have received little attention. The design and planning of concrete formwork systems, however, would substantially benefit from the capabilities of BIM. Formwork design is repetitive and can be very time-consuming due to the need to analyze multiple parameters of individual permanent components, the latest formwork design guidelines, methods, and procedures, and the available materials. In this study, a BIM-based tool is developed and proposed to assist designers and builders in planning, designing, and generating concrete formwork design models for planning purposes. By integrating the design procedures recommended by the American Concrete Institute (ACI), the streamlining tool automates the design and modeling process for timber concrete formwork through an application programming interface (API) in Revit. The workability of the proposed tool was demonstrated through a case study. The study also employed the survey method to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed tool and its potential for improving worker safety and health from the perspectives of formwork professionals. Using the tool, form designers and planners will be able to determine the most applicable formwork design based on the permanent facility structure along with the availability of construction materials, site conditions present, and worker safety and health considerations.

In the paper, we propose Symbolic-Execution CNN (SE-CNN), which breaks data dependence between CNN layers via value prediction. Our insight is that in post-trained CNNs, only a subset (less than 10%) of neurons are activated (producing non-zero values) to identify patterns in inputs while most of the other neurons remain silent (producing zeros). This is because given an input image there are only a limited number of features presented. Thus, within the CNN, the neurons that are sensitive to the given features are more exercised than the others. Based on this insight, SE-CNN works in two successive phases: A <italic>parallel</italic> computation phase and a <italic>serial</italic> correction phase. In the parallel computation phase, each CNN layer starts computation simultaneously based on predicted inputs: we predict most of the neurons having zeros as inputs. For non-zero input neurons we predict their inputs for the next input image the same as the previous ones. In the serial correction phase, each layer compares the predicted inputs with the real ones to correct its computation results if necessary. If a neuron has predicted correctly its input during the <italic>parallel</italic> phase, thus the corresponding neuron passes its <italic>serial</italic> phase. Otherwise the neuron will amend its prediction with a light-weight result amendment mechanism based on the real inputs. We implement SE-CNN on top of the streaming processor of a state-of-the-art general purpose GPU (GPGPU) architecture, adding marginal hardware overheads in area and power consumption. We also provide application programming interfaces (APIs) so that CNNs that have already been implemented can directly enjoy the benefits of our technique. We utilize GPGPU-sim as our experimental platform, benchmarked with 9 well-accepted CNNs from recent years&#x2019; ILSVRC contests. Experimental results show that compared to other three state-of-the-art GPU based CNN acceleration mechanisms, SE-CNN can averagely achieve 13.4&#x00D7;, 10.4&#x00D7; and 7.9&#x00D7; (maximally 22.0&#x00D7;, 18.7&#x00D7; and 16.4&#x00D7;) CNN execution speedup while maintaining over 95% of classification accuracy.

HyMalD performs the static and dynamic analyses logically simultaneously to detect obfuscated malware, which is impossible to do using static analysis alone. First, it extracts static features of the opcode sequence using a reconstructed dataset according to the obfuscation and extracts the application programming interface (API) call sequence dynamically. The extracted features are trained through the Bi-LSTM and SPP-Net models, which HyMalD uses to detect and classify IoT malware. The performance of HyMalD was evaluated, and its detection accuracy was 92.5%. The false-negative rate (FNR) of HyMalD was 7.67%.

These scenarios require rapid assignment decisions to engage moving targets having dynamic flight paths. In defensive operations, the success of a sequence of air battle management decisions is reflected by the friendly force's ability to maintain air superiority and defend friendly assets. We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model of a stochastic dynamic assignment problem, named the Air Battle Management Problem (ABMP), wherein a set of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) must defend an asset from cruise missiles arriving stochastically over time. Attaining an exact solution using traditional dynamic programming techniques is computationally intractable. Hence, we utilize an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) technique known as approximate policy iteration with least squares temporal differences (API-LSTD) learning to find high-quality solutions to the ABMP. We create a simulation environment in conjunction with a generic yet representative combat scenario to illustrate how the ADP solution compares in quality to a reasonable, closest-intercept benchmark policy. Our API-LSTD policy improves mean success rate by 2.8% compared to the benchmark policy and offers an 81.7% increase in the frequency with which the policy performs perfectly. Moreover, we find the increased success rate of the ADP policy is, on average, equivalent to the success rate attained by the benchmark policy when using a 20% faster UCAV. These results inform military force management and defense acquisition decisions and aid in the development of more effective tactics, techniques, and procedures. © 2022","Antennas; Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Decision making; Dynamic programming; Iterative methods; Military vehicles; Network security; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Air battle management; Approximate dynamic programming; Assignment problems; Battle management; Dynamic assignment; Dynamic assignment problem; Management problems; Markov Decision Processes; OR in defense; Stochastic dynamics; Markov processes","Air battle management; Approximate dynamic programming; Dynamic assignment problem; Markov decision process; OR in defense","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133627020"

Such a process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we show an end-to-end study to train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based virtual treatment planner (VTP) that can behave like a human to operate a dose-volume constrained treatment plan optimization engine following the parameters used in Eclipse TPS for high-quality treatment planning. We considered the prostate cancer IMRT treatment plan as the testbed. The VTP took the dose-volume histogram (DVH) of a plan as input and predicted the optimal strategy for constraint adjustment to improve the plan quality. The training of VTP followed the state-of-the-art Q-learning framework. Experience replay was implemented with epsilon-greedy search to explore the impacts of taking different actions on a large number of automatically generated plans, from which an optimal policy can be learned. Since a major computational cost in training was to solve the plan optimization problem repeatedly, we implemented a graphical processing unit (GPU)-based technique to improve the efficiency by 2-fold. Upon the completion of training, the established VTP was deployed to plan for an independent set of 50 testing patient cases. Connecting the established VTP with the Eclipse workstation via the application programming interface, we tested the performance the VTP in operating Eclipse TPS for automatic treatment planning with another two independent patient cases. Like a human planner, VTP kept adjusting the planning objectives/constraints to improve plan quality until the plan was acceptable or the maximum number of adjustment steps was reached under both scenarios. The generated plans were evaluated using the ProKnow scoring system. The mean plan score (± standard deviation) of the 50 testing cases were improved from 6.18 ± 1.75 to 8.14 ± 1.27 by the VTP, with 9 being the maximal score. As for the two cases under Eclipse dose optimization, the plan scores were improved from 8 to 8.4 and 8.7 respectively by the VTP. These results indicated that the proposed DRL-based VTP was able to operate the in-house dose-volume constrained TPS and Eclipse TPS to automatically generate high-quality treatment plans for prostate cancer IMRT. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd","Humans; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Software; Application programming interfaces (API); Constrained optimization; Diseases; Graphics processing unit; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Urology; Virtual reality; Automatic treatment; Automatic treatment planning; Deep learning; Dose-volume; Optimisations; Q-learning; Treatment planning; Treatment planning optimization; Treatment planning systems; Article; cancer patient; controlled study; dose volume histogram; intensity modulated radiation therapy; prostate cancer; treatment planning; human; male; procedures; prostate tumor; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; software; Deep learning","automatic treatment planning; deep learning; Q learning; reinforcement learning; treatment planning optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131668731"

ADHD and ASD diagnosis mainly rely heavily on traditional clinical assessments from the last few decades. These traditional methods are based on massive data collection from multiple respondents' responses and the extent of various behavioral descriptors, which are then recognized by the researcher while forming a diagnostic criterion. However, opting for traditional diagnostic methods, there is a high possibility of being misdiagnosed, which may lead to the administration of unnecessary long-term pharmaceutical treatment. That may lead to reduction in functioning and an increase in the risk of developing additional social and clinical issues. Moreover, such diagnostic procedures are also time-consuming and costly. In this sense, rapid and advanced criteria are required to be accurate and cost-effective. Consequently, this study emphasizes the application of machine learning (ML) tools and deep learning (DL) techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and Deep Learning APIs (Application Programming Interface), for the early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD and ASD symptoms. From this investigation, it can be concluded that diagnostic techniques based on ML reduce the intervention time and increase the accuracy with simultaneous understanding of the techniques and algorithms applied to different types of Image data.

Automatically generating URLs is helpful in various tasks, such as application debugging, API testing, and blocklist creation for security applications. Current testing suites deeply embed experts&#x2019; domain knowledge to generate suitable URLs, resulting in an ad-hoc solution for each given application. These tools thus require heavy manual intervention, with the expensive coding of rules that are hard to maintain. We here introduce URLGEN, a system that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to tackle the automatic URL generation problem. URLGEN is designed for web API testing and generates URL samples for an application without any system expertise, complementing the existing tools. It leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, augmented by an embedding layer that simplifies the URL learning and generation process. We show that URLGEN learns to generate new valid URLs from samples of real URLs without requiring any domain knowledge and following a purely data-driven approach. We compare the GAN architecture of URLGEN against other design options and show that the LSTM architecture can better capture the correlation among URL characters, outperforming previously proposed solutions. Finally, we show that the URLGEN approach can be extended to other scenarios, which we illustrate with two use cases, i.e., cybersquatting domain prediction and URL classification.

Finally, an implementation of the method using Siemens NX and the Robotics Toolbox for Python is presented and tested on three geometrically different node configurations and a stiffener piece provided by industrial collaborators. In all, the proposed system was able to correctly generate programs adhering to allowed welding operations as long as a solution existed. For the more complex node configurations (which require reorientation when welded by humans), 32 weld path programs out of 42 were generated based on the given criteria. For the least complex node, a total of 20 out of 24 were generated with the same criteria. All 14 weld programs were generated for the stiffener representation. © 2023, The Author(s).","Aluminum; Application programming interfaces (API); Machine design; Robot programming; Topology; Welding; Welds; Aluminum welding; Automatic offline programming; Computer-aided design; Off line programming; Product customization; Robot programs; Robot welding; Robotic welding; Welding conditions; Welding operations; Computer aided design","Automatic offline programming; Computer-aided design; Robotic welding","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149485436"

Then, the computationally intensive parts of the PMLFMA on each MPI process, matrix filling, aggregation and disaggregation, and so on are accelerated by using the GPU. Different parallelization strategies in coincidence with the ternary parallel MLFMA approach are designed for GPU to ensure high computational throughput. Special memory usage strategy is designed to improve computational efficiency and benefit data reusing. The CPU/GPU asynchronous computing pattern is designed with the OpenMP and compute unified device architecture (CUDA), respectively, for accelerating the CPU and GPU execution parts and computation time overlapped. GPU architecture-based optimization strategies are implemented to further improve the computational efficiency.

In this article, we have introduced a hybrid-parallel intuitionistic-near set based fusion scheme through near feature map approach.

First, the fuzzy image representation based intuitionistic fuzzy theory is considered. Second, the principal features in the infrared and visual images are mapped using near-fuzzy set. Third, final fusion features are measured from decomposed multiple image blocks through domain decomposition strategy and image features are extracted via a defined probe function. After that, the near features have been computed from both the original images via intuitionistic entropy-based probe function, the ultimate fusion image is achieved through perceptual threshold limit on the membership grades in the fuzzy space. Finally, the resultant fused image is obtained through defuzzification. A hybrid MPI and OpenMP model is adopted to reduce inter-node communication and parallelized codes.

In 1900, Kuzushiji was not included in regular school curricula due to the change in the Japanese writing system. Nowadays Japanese natives are unable to read historical books that were written using Kuzushiji language. Therefore, libraries and museums have decided to build digital copies of the documents and books that were written in Kuzushiji language. Due to a limited number of trained experts, researchers have utilized machine and deep learning models to convert historical documents and books into a modern script that can be easily read by human beings. However, the existing deep learning techniques suffer from over-fitting and gradient vanishing problems. To overcome these problems, an efficient deep Kuzushiji characters recognition network (DKNet) is proposed. Initially, to remove noise from the training images, a trilateral joint filter is applied. Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is then applied to enhance the visibility of filtered images. Thereafter, a pre-trained MobileNet is utilized to extract the features of Kuzushiji characters. MobileNet's final layers are removed, including the fully connected layer and softmax. The flatten layer is then applied to the input. A fully connected classification layer is then used with Rectified linear units (ReLUs) and dropouts. Dropouts are used to generalize the model, thus preventing the over-fitting problem. Finally, the softmax activation function is employed to provide the recognition results. To test the proposed model, actual documents are first segmented by using the proposed Maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) and convexhull-based segmentation approach. Segmented characters are then recognized using the trained DKNet. Extensive comparative analyses reveal that DKNet achieves better performance than the competitive models in terms of various performance metrics. An efficient Application Programming Interface (API) is also designed for Japanese Kuzushiji ancient heritage character recognition to help the end-users. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bandpass filters; Deep learning; Digital libraries; E-learning; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Deep learning; Deep learning model; Features extraction; Inceptionnet; Information filter; Kuzushiji character recognition; Learning models; Maximally Stable Extremal Regions; Mobilenet; Neural-networks; Resnet; Writing; Character recognition","deep learning models; InceptionNet; Kuzushiji character recognition; Maximally stable extremal regions; MobileNet; ResNet","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135215417"

In order to overcome this problem, we propose an ensemble-based approach to Open APIs recommendation with a multiple feature model, which integrates both machine learning and deep learning and synthesizes a set of multiple features to accurately make the recommendation. This approach employs One-hot, Word2vec similarity and Matrix Factorization techniques to obtain the multiple features information respectively, then concatenates the features to obtain a Multivariate Information Feature (MIF) matrix, and leverages an optimized Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for feature selection. GBDT is good at processing dense numerical features, while GRU is good at processing sparse categorical features, Finally, the results are synthesized to obtain a recommendation result.

Most of these malware programs are malware variants such as polymorphic and metamorphic malware, which are created from older versions of malware and able to change their structures and function flows to circumvent security solutions. The accuracy of malware variant detection is a crucial challenge. Many existing malware variant detections use static features extracted from the physical structure of malware file, such as opcodes and function flows. Unfortunately, the static features are subject to obfuscation and code shelling using simple obfuscation techniques. Although a malware variant can change its structure and function flows, it is widely believed that the malware variant cannot hide its malicious behavioral patterns during the runtime. Accordingly, dynamic, or behavioral analysis-based features were suggested by many studies to detect malware variants accurately. However, most of these studies are solely dependent on application-programmable interface calls (or API calls), which is not enough to accurately distinguish between malware and benign due to API-based obfuscation techniques. Therefore, a malware variant detection model that combines different behavioral activities can improve detection accuracy while reducing the false-negative rate. To this end, this study proposed a Deep-Ensemble and Multifaceted Behavioral Malware Variant Detection Model using Sequential Deep Learning and Extreme Gradient Boosting Techniques. Different behavioral features were extracted from the dynamic analysis environment. Then, a feature extraction algorithm that can automatically extract effective representative patterns has been designed and developed to extract the hidden representative features of the malware variants using a sequential deep learning model. These features have been fed into a developed extreme gradient boosting-based classifier for decision making. Extensive experiments have been carried out to validate the proposed scheme. The results were compared to the other related techniques in the field. The results show that the proposed model is reliable, as it improves the detection rate while reducing the false-negative rate.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Decision making; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Heuristic algorithms; Malware; Behavioral features; Boosting; Deep ensemble learning; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Features extraction; Heuristics algorithm; Malware detection; Malware variant; Multifaceted behavioral feature; Security; Sequential deep learning; Static analysis","Deep ensemble learning; Malware detection; Malware variants; Multifaceted behavioral features; Sequential deep learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129184274"

Then, improved implementation techniques for the BDD-MPC method are proposed. The computation speed of the projection procedure in the conjugate projected gradient method is improved using the block diagonal structure of the constraint matrix. The parallel solution procedure for the coarse-grid problem considering the MPCs that are projected to the coarse space is also improved. The improved MPC-BDD method is implemented in ADVENTURE_Solid, which is a parallel finite element structural analysis code. The code is parallelized using an MPI-OpenMP hybrid parallel implementation framework. In the previous study, the BDD-MPC method was applied to only simple numerical examples.

In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional networks, SDN has come into the picture. SDN is a recent and fast-forwarding technique that involves separating the network's control plane from the data plane. This network also allows us to directly communicate with the applications through application programming interfaces. A network administrator can directly modify and update the routing policies and rules in SDN. Apart from the advantages given by the SDN, it has also been found that separation of control plane directly affects the network performance. Finding the optimum number of controllers and their locations to improve the performance is one of the fundamental research problems in SDN which is also commonly known as the controller placement problem (CPP). In this article, we have addressed the CPP in SDN in detail and investigated the optimization objectives that influence CPP. The state-of-the-art of this article is to review almost all the optimization objective along with their mathematical formulation and survey the CPP solutions proposed by the other researchers'. Classified the CPP into three parts based on the objectives and solutions of CPP and reviewed the impact of these objectives on network performance.

These data do not require the strong data protection typical SSDs use to reliably store data for a guaranteed period. In recent years, SSD&#x2019;s density has been growing rapidly at the cost of degraded reliability, forcing SSD vendors to trade endurance and performance for stronger error protection. An intuitive question to ask is&#x201C;, What if the SSD can identify these short-lived data to save the tax of over-protection?&#x201D; In this paper, we answer affirmatively with a novel co-design called, ZoneLife, which exposes the data lifetime semantics from applications to the SSD. ZoneLife enables the SSD to select the optimal Error-Correction Code (ECC) out of multiple codes of different strengths. As a result, the SSD can store short-lived data with significantly less resources. ZoneLife efficiently translates the data addresses of different lifetimes with a multi-granularity flash-translation-layer (FTL). Existing systems can easily adopt ZoneLife with localized modifications because ZoneLife&#x2019;s host driver API generalizes Linux&#x2019;s write hint interface, and its device firmware utilizes the popular Zone Namespace interface.

It proposes an optimized methodology of the functional equivalent translation from source program languages to formal languages. This methodology utilizes an external application programming interface (API) table to replace the source codes in compilation, thereby pruning the part of housekeeping codes to ease code inflation. Code inflation is a significant metric in formal language translation. Namely, minor code inflation enhances verification scale and performance efficiency. It determines the efficiency of formal verification, involving launching, running, and memory usage. For instance, path explosion increases exponentially, resulting in out-of-memory. The experimental results conclude that program languages like golang severely impact code inflation. FVPS reduces the wasm code size by over 90%, achieving two orders of optimization magnitude, from 2000 kilobyte (KB) to 90 KB. That means we can cope with golang applications up to 20 times larger than the original in scale. This work eliminates the gap between Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts and WebAssembly. Our approach is pragmatic, adaptable, extendable, and flexible. Nowadays, FVPS is successfully applied in a Railway-Port-Aviation blockchain transportation system. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

A large number of scholars have studied the optimization of ship pipe routes, but there is still a lack of a fast and effective method for the automatic design of complex pipe routes. For this reason, this article proposes the auto-routing methods of single pipes, branch pipes, and multipipes. The auto-routing methods are based on an Improved A*algorithm. Compared with the traditional A*algorithm, the Improved A*algorithm considers the constraints of ship pipe route design. And by introducing ""Blocking Iteration"" and dynamic weight, the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are improved. On this basis, this article uses Python and OpenGL to develop the automatic pipe route design system. The system supports the automatic pipe route design, visualization of optimization results, and two-way interaction with three-dimensional (3-D) design software.

Firstly, the indoor model is established by 3DMAX software, and the model is imported into the OpenGL 3D graphics standard library module. Secondly, the basic geometric elements are used to draw the indoor soft decoration scene elements, and the scene elements are constrained through the through wall, overlap and size constraint functions to ensure the reasonable layout of the indoor soft decoration agent area and enrich the indoor model. After the enrichment, the indoor model is transmitted to the transformation unit of Direct3D rendering engine module to implement the soft decoration layout. Finally, the lighting unit and rasterization unit are used to render the indoor layout, obtain the optimal indoor soft decoration effect, and output the three-dimensional simulation image of indoor soft decoration.

Since traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran, do not support parallelism at the level of multi-core processors and accelerators, many programmers add one or more programming models to achieve parallelism and accelerate computation efficiently. These models include Open Accelerators (OpenACC) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), which have recently been used with various models, including Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Due to the difficulty of predicting the behavior of threads, runtime errors cannot be predicted. The compiler cannot identify runtime errors such as data races, race conditions, deadlocks, or livelocks. Many studies have been conducted on the development of testing tools to detect runtime errors when using programming models, such as the combinations of OpenACC with MPI models and OpenMP with MPI. Although more applications use OpenACC and OpenMP together, no testing tools have been developed to test these applications to date. This paper presents a testing tool for detecting runtime using a static testing technique. This tool can detect actual and potential runtime errors during the integration of the OpenACC and OpenMP models into systems developed in C++. This tool implement error dependency graphs, which are proposed in this paper. Additionally, a dependency graph of the errors is provided, along with a classification of runtime errors that result from combining the two programming models mentioned earlier.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); C++ (programming language); Computer graphics; Errors; FORTRAN (programming language); Graphics processing unit; Message passing; Modeling languages; Parallel processing systems; Parallel programming; Program processors; Testing; C language; Computational modelling; Deadlock; Exascale; Exascale system; High-performance computing; Multi-processing; Open accelerator; Open multi-processing; Parallel processing; Performance computing; Programming; Programming models; Run-time errors; Runtimes; Software testings; Static testing; Testing tool classification; Testing tools; Software testing","deadlock; exascale systems; high-performance computing; OpenACC; OpenMP; Parallel programming; programming models; race condition; runtime errors; software testing; static testing; testing tools classifications","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141604340"

Useful rule-checking systems could contribute to a quicker project delivery time. Currently, an efficient method for checking the logical relationship is still lacking. This study aims to propose an MEP rule checking framework using the subgraph matching technology. First, the MEP components in the BIM model are extracted by utilizing the application programming interface (API), and a graph database is established with point-based and curve-based instances being nodes and relationships, respectively. Second, the graph database is simplified to increase the speed of graph matching. Third, the rules, which regulate how the MEP components should be connected, are represented by a knowledge graph. Finally, rule checking is achieved by comparing the graph database against the knowledge graph, and the critical path in a sub-system is detected by calculating the betweenness centrality. A case study with a rail station is used to evaluate the approach where the overall model checking and rule checking are conducted on the original and simplified graph databases sequentially. The results show that the proposed approach could achieve the rule compliance checking at a high speed, and 6 unconnected instances along with 155 problematic pipe fittings have been found. Besides, the critical path for the selected ACS system is from the water-cooled chiller to the condenser water pump. The proposed framework could help in the overall model checking and rule checking process, improving the efficiency of BIM engineers.

Moreover, the cost of supplying some resources has increased substantially. Hence, the manufacturer is trying to focus on planning to get back old or partially/wholly unusable products and make the best disposition decisions on them. This research aims to build a multi-industry applied model using the deep learning method in social media analysis to make the best decision for returning products in reverse logistics, along with the sustainability and circular economy concerns. Furthermore, we outline the usage of social network analytics in aligning consumers’ expectations with supply chain policies, strategies, and decisions. An industry benchmark concerning circular economy concepts can be attained by applying the proposed model to different industries. We have proposed a generalisable model using social media analytics, consumer sentiment analysis, reverse logistics, and circular economy theory to attain a circular supply chain regarding sustainability concerns. Applying the proposed model to the electronics industry as a case study, the model was further validated with Twitter data analysis of developing versus developed countries for laptop devices. We collected over 70-million tweets using the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) over fifteen months. The results approved the proposed model by leveraging the Twitter geolocation attribute to extract Twitter data from developing and developed countries. Moreover, the model is general enough to be used on various industries’ supply chains and provides managers and policymakers with deep insight into reverse logistics’ decision-making. It would be interesting to use real-time analytics and improve accuracy in future works. We made original contributions to reverse logistics decision-making in the circular economy context. Previous research, which has focused on supply chain decision-making, has been extended by providing theoretical and practical implications for social media analytics and the circular economy ecosystem. Thus, by scrutinising the consumers’ needs and expectations, we suggested the best decision on returned products to close an open-ended supply chain and achieve a circular economy. Furthermore, we derived industry benchmarks for both developing and developed countries separately. The results showed that the best decision on returning products in developing countries is different from developed countries.

For offshore pipelines or cables, curvature constraints are typically important not only due to the flexural rigidity but also the maneuverability of the laying vessels. Roads are subject to similar curvature constraints to ensure the safety of users travelling at the design speed. Yet, such constraints are not taken into account in traditional least cost routing methods, often based on Dijkstra’s algorithm. Post-process smoothing is often necessary, resulting in non-optimal routes. We present a new method for least cost route optimization, allowing to incorporate the curvature constraints into the primary calculations as opposed to a post-determination consideration. With this technique, smoothing of the least cost route becomes unnecessary, preserving its optimal character. Optimization algorithms for the trajectories of forward-moving vehicles were adapted for the routing of linear infrastructures and modified to include an angular discretization of variable resolution, resulting in faster and more accurate results. In addition to the inclusion of curvature constraints, the proposed method offers a higher flexibility in terms of local route orientation compared to the traditional Dijkstra’s algorithm, producing routes of lower cost. The numerical solver was implemented on parallel architectures, to compute optimal routes on realistic domains in reasonable computational times. For personal computers with a few computing cores, the OpenMP implementation on Central Processing Units does not significantly increase the iteration count and provides significant speedups. For certain configurations, the use of Graphical Processing Units reduces further the computational time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Constrained optimization; Curve fitting; Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Maneuverability; Offshore oil well production; Offshore pipelines; Personal computers; Program processors; Angular discretization; Curvature constrained; Curvature constraints; Flexural rigidities; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Linear infrastructure; Optimization algorithms; Variable resolution; Parallel architectures","Cable; Fast sweeping; Least cost route; Optimization; Parallel processing; Pipeline; Route; Routing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102559003"

Managers of the events can quickly search and locate the staff on the specific area of the map in real-time, and make broadcasting messages to the staff, and manage the staff. The client app is developed on the Android system, by which staff users can send the positions information to the server timely. The client users can search fuzzily near their peers and list their locations, and also call near peers through sending messages or query the history record of staff locations. In the design of the system, several new proposed techniques, including visual annotation method for overlapping locations, correcting trajectory drift algorithm, microservices-based overall system architecture methodology and other new techniques, which are applied to the implementation of the system. Also, HTML5, JQuery, MLBS APIs (Application Program Interfaces) related programming techniques have been used and combined with loading Ajax asynchronously and Json data encapsulation, map marker optimization techniques, that can improve the positioning accuracy and the performance of the system. The developed system with practical functions can enhance the efficiencies of the organization and management of major events. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

Application Programming Interfaces (API) calls contain valuable information that can help with malware identification. The malware analysis with reduced feature space helps for the efficient identification of malware. The goal of this research is to find the most informative features of API calls to improve the android malware detection accuracy. Three swarm optimization methods, viz., Ant Lion Optimization (ALO), Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO), and Firefly Optimization (FO) are applied to API calls using auto-encoders for identification of most influential features. The nature-inspired wrapper-based algorithms are evaluated using well-known Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K–Nearest Neighbor (KNN) & Support Vector Machine (SVM). A hybrid Artificial Neuronal Classifier (ANC) is proposed for improving the classification of android malware.

The new method uses 4D digital image information and information from a thresholded 4D image in a local neighborhood. Thus, the 4D image segmentation is accomplished by defining the edge detector function’s input as the weighted sum of the norm of gradients of presmoothed 4D image and norm of presmoothed thresholded 4D image in a local neighborhood. Additionally, we design and study a numerical method based on the finite volume approach for solving the new model. The reduced diamond cell approach is used for approximating the gradient of the solution. We use a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the numerical discretization and show that our numerical scheme is unconditionally stable. The new 4D method was tested on artificial data and applied to real data representing 3D+time microscopy images of cell nuclei within the zebrafish pectoral fin and hind-brain. In a real application, processing 3D+time microscopy images amounts to solving a linear system with several billion unknowns and requires over 1000 GB of memory; thus, it may not be possible to process these images on a serial machine without parallel implementation utilizing the MPI. Consequently, we develop and present in the paper OpenMP and MPI parallel implementation of designed algorithms.

Mobile applications and websites access the sensors and use them in a variety of ways. Permission is required to access permission-imposed sensors, while users can access no-permission imposed sensors directly without any permission by using the generic sensor application programming interface (API). An attacker targets these sensors and makes smartphones vulnerable at the application and network level. Attackers gain access to sensor information and use it for various purposes like identifying personal identification numbers (PINs) and stealing personal information. This paper presents BPLMSBT, a novel Blockchain-based permission list for mitigating smartphone sensor-based threats by allowing benign users to access sensors through various channels. The permission list contains benign sources with sensor access permissions, while the blacklist contains malicious sources that access the sensors. Blockchain avoids the risks of centralized lists and maintains the list's integrity through the immutability feature. Experimental results indicate that the proposed defence mechanism consumes less overhead and is more efficient.

Fluid dynamic air brake models are sometimes required for train dynamics simulations to utilise their advantages in physical descriptions and model scalabilities. Due to the high complexity of fluid dynamic air brake models, the most economic approach to add such models to train dynamics simulation is via co-simulations. This paper presents three methods that can be used for co-simulations of train braking dynamics. These models are based on Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Message Passing Interface (MPI) techniques, respectively. Requirements for co-simulations of train braking dynamics are discussed. Code structures regarding how to implement these techniques for train braking dynamics simulations are presented and discussed. Demonstrative simulations using dummy programs are presented to show the effectiveness of these methods. Comparatively, OpenMP, MPI, and TCP/IP have an increasing level of complexity for implementations as well as commination time overhead. OpenMP and MPI also allow parallel computing to increase computing speeds.

By using many malicious strategies, the number of malware is steadily increasing. Increasing Android malware threats numerous users, and thus, it is necessary to detect malware quickly and accurately. Each malware has distinguishable characteristics based on its actions. Therefore, security researchers have tried to categorize malware based on their behaviors by conducting the familial analysis which can help analysists to reduce the time and cost for analyzing malware. However, those studies algorithms typically used imbalanced, well-labeled open-source dataset, and thus, it is very difficult to classify some malware families which only have a few number of malware. To overcome this challenge, previous data augmentation studies augmented data by visualizing malicious codes and used them for malware analysis. However, visualization of malware can result in misclassifications because the behavior information of the malware could be compromised. In this study, we propose an android malware familial analysis system based on a data augmentation method that preserves malware behaviors to create an effective multi-class classifier for malware family analysis. To this end, we analyze malware and use Application Programming Interface (APIs) and permissions that can reflect the behavior of malware as features. By using these features, we augment malware dataset to enable effective malware detection while preserving original malicious behaviors.

Although methods based on global and local features have been combined, their performance is typically determined by feature fusion. This study proposes enhanced discriminative global-local feature learning with priority (EDGL-FLP), which focuses on feature extraction without auxiliary information and feature fusion based on priority. The proposed uniform mixing multiscale module traverses all subset combinations for global features to solve the insufficient information mixing problem in the existing multiscale module. A novel saliency and statistics-aware attention module is proposed for local features to extract the channel and spatial attention of saliency and statistics in two subbranches. It avoids information confusion caused by the early channel attention fusion in the convolutional block attention module. The global features are enhanced with core face area features and fused with half-face features for additional discriminative guidance because faces are symmetrical and their center is crucial. EDGL-FLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FER benchmarks RAF-DB, SFEW, AffectNet, FED-RO, and MMI with accuracies of 89.63%, 62.31%, 61.09%, 71.42%, and 86.47%, respectively.

Consequently, it has been widely adopted by practitioners and educators alike and is deeply ingrained in many curricula that teach real-time graphics for higher education. Over the years, the architecture of graphics processing units (GPUs) incrementally diverged from OpenGL's conceptual design. The more recently introduced Vulkan API provides a more modern, fine-grained approach for interfacing with the GPU, which allows a high level of controllability and, thereby, deep insights into the inner workings of modern GPUs. This property makes the Vulkan API especially well suitable for teaching graphics programming in university education, where fundamental knowledge shall be conveyed. Hence, it stands to reason that educators who have their students’ best interests at heart should provide them with corresponding lecture material. However, Vulkan is notoriously verbose and rather challenging for first-time users, thus transitioning to this new API bears a considerable risk of failing to achieve expected teaching goals. In this paper, we document our experiences after teaching Vulkan in both introductory and advanced graphics courses side-by-side with conventional OpenGL. A collection of surveys enables us to draw conclusions about perceived workload, difficulty, and students’ acceptance of either approach. In doing so, we identify suitable conditions and recommendations for teaching Vulkan to both undergraduate and graduate students. © 2023 The Author(s)","Application programming interfaces (API); Conceptual design; Curricula; Program processors; Rendering (computer graphics); Students; Teaching; Fine grained; Graphic programming; Graphics APIs; Graphics applications; High educations; Programming framework; Property; Real time graphics; Real-time rendering; Vulkan; Graphics processing unit","GPU; Graphics API; Programming framework; Real-time rendering; Teaching; Vulkan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148545178"

That technology permits the creation of working applications more quickly and with minimal manual coding. Low-code platforms include visual development tools permitting the assembly of applied logic from preexisting components. By that means, problems may potentially be solved by a wide range of specialists in particular applied regions without deep knowledge of programming. That provides competitive benefits to enterprises utilizing low-code platforms. It is found that low-code technology is not confined to the corresponding specialized platforms but may utilize any tools that decrease the volume and complexity of manual operations in solving IT and business problems and minimize the departments and specialists involved in the path from an idea to a working application. It is shown that the servers and services at the core of such systems support a set of characteristics important for high-load applications and permit the rapid solution of business problems on the basis of a ready-made set of entities and standard processes. © 2022, Allerton Press, Inc.","Software design; Web services; API interface; Business problems; Business Process; Cloud platforms; Digital transformation; Industrial internet of thing; Low-code platform; Smartapp service; WEB application; Web applications; Application programming interfaces (API)","API interfaces; business processes; cloud platforms; digital transformation; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); low-code platforms; SmartApp services; web applications","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144210421"

Malicious code is the most common means of network attack, which threatens user information and property security. An effective malicious code classification method can improve the efficiency of malicious code detection and the ability to discover new malicious code families. This study proposes a new malicious code classification method to analyze, classify, and detect malicious code. The semantic features of opcode sequences are extracted effectively by introducing the concept of word vectors. Furthermore, the extracted sequence is regarded as a text sentence and then introduced to a text convolutional neural network (textCNN) to identify malicious code families. The experimental results revealed that the model has more than 98% accuracy (with macro-average precision above 98.65% and macro-average recall approximately 98.66%) on the Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset conducted in 2015. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the model on the SOREL-20M dataset is 91.93%. Mostly call instructions are used to call the API, library functions, and other user-defined functions through which the behavior of malicious code is generally realized. Thus, selecting the block that contains call instructions as the key block will reduce the model training speed. After selecting the key block, on average, the number of opcodes on Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset is reduced by 39.07% and has a 98.18% accuracy rate, which is slightly lower than the result obtained by using all opcodes. The number of opcodes on the SOREL-20M dataset is reduced by 30.49% on average, and the accuracy is increased to 93.46%. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works well and outperforms the results obtained by using byte n-gram representation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Network coding; Network security; Semantics; Text processing; Classification methods; Code classification; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Malicious code classification; Malicious codes; Op-code sequence; Opcodes; Text convolutional neural network; Word embedding; Malware","Malicious code classification; Opcode sequences; Text convolutional neural network; Word embedding","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127796203"

The one-dimensional centrifugal cascade dynamic hydraulics calculation program can be used to achieve the rapid verification of the cascade system dynamic operation or accident condition. While the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program is mainly used to analyze the local three-dimensional fluid phenomena such as the centrifugal cascade pipe and equipment. To comprehensively utilize the advantages of the two simulation methods, based on the one-dimensional calculation software SimuWorks of centrifugal cascade hydraulics and three-dimensional flow field calculation software Fluent, a one-dimensional and three-dimensional coupling simulation program for centrifugal cascade hydraulics was developed by using the API functions provided by SimuWorks simulation software and the user-defined function (UDF) of Fluent. The coupling method is used to analyze the movement of solid particles in the main feed pipe of the separation stage. By comparing the calculation results of the coupling program with the calculation results of the traditional one-dimensional dynamic hydraulics program, it can be seen that the coupling program can correctly predict the influence of feeding orifice plate clogging on the system parameters and can more intuitively show the flow field characteristics in the important parts of the system. The motion characteristics of the solid particles obtained in the simulation verification are consistent with the experimental analysis results, which further verifies the accuracy of the coupling program.

For platform enterprises, how to drive third-party value creation through interface extensibility investment (typically on application programming interfaces, or APIs) under different pricing schemes, has become a critical issue under intensified competition. In this paper, we build game theoretic models in four platform competition scenarios (NR, NRT, IR, IRT) considering both investment decisions—no investment (N), investment (I), and pricing decisions—registration fee only (R), registration fee and transaction fee (RT), and analyze the competitive equilibrium in each scenario. Our results show that: (1) Although “reducing price” and “enhancing investment” are partial substitutes, platforms are still incentivized to implement both strategies. Contrary to the traditional wisdom, when platforms with investment charge both registration and transaction fees, the strengthening of cross-side network effect may lead to an increase in registration fee on both sides. (2) The improvement of interface extension effectiveness (cost reduction for developers per unit of investment from platforms) shifts more developers from single-homing to multi-homing, leading to fiercer market competition and thus lower platform profit in equilibrium. (3) Although implementing investment may not be optimal from the profit perspective, it does help platforms in securing a larger market share on the developer side. (4) The existence of same-side network effect enhances both side users’ incentive to enter the market; however, for the platforms, they should carefully mind the irrational price competition to avoid falling into profit-hurting traps. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Commerce; Competition; Cost reduction; Ecosystems; Game theory; Profitability; Supply chain management; Applications programming interfaces; Investment decisions; Multi-homing; Partial multi-homing; Platform ecosystems; Pricing decision; Registration fees; Side networks; Third parties; Two-sided markets; Investments","Application programming interface; Partial multi-homing; Platform ecosystem; Supply chain management; Two-sided market","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138585424"

In IaaS clouds, tenants deploy software-defined networking (SDN) policies to simplify network management and customize network behaviors. However, programming SDN networks is error-prone no matter using low-level APIs or high-level programming languages. Specifically, SDN policies may contain misconfigurations that do not break the pre-defined network invariants (e.g., black holes), but either degrade the deployment efficiency or mistakenly translate tenants intents. Prior studies for checking either traditional access control policies or network-wide invariants, are thus fail to detect these misconfigurations. To address this gap, this paper presents PMM, a misconfiguration checking tool for compositional SDN that works at the data plane of cloud networks. We first propose a new data structure, minimal interval set, to represent the match patterns of rulesets. This representation serves the basis for composition algebra construction and misconfiguration checking. We then propose the principles, algorithms and also optimisations for fast and accurate checking. We finally implement PMM in Covisor.

The transitions occurring in this flow phenomena have the relevancy with geophysical motions. In this paper, we use the time-dependent three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (3D-INSEs) to investigate distinct flow modes for a wide-gap clearance ratio (CR) (Formula presented.). An Artificial Compressibility method has been used along with three implicit solvers, i.e. alternating direction implicit (ADI), line Gauss–Seidel (LGS), and point Gauss–Seidel (PGS). We apply the basic techniques of OpenMP to our Fortran code. First, we make a performance comparison of the three implicit solvers running on a single central processing unit (CPU) with that of the multi-core CPUs using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) to choose the best solver for the simulation of the SCF problem. The comparison shows that the ADI solver is the most efficient solver compared to LGS and PGS solvers. Using the most efficient parallel ADI solver, we compute distinct flow modes for this wide gap in a range of Reynolds number (Formula presented.) between (Formula presented.). For this wide gap, first we obtain the basic 0-vortex flow (0-VF) at (Formula presented.). By increasing the (Formula presented.) the flow becomes symmetric 1-vortex flow (1-VF) and asymmetric spiral 1-VF at (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) respectively. The flow returns back to super critical basic flow at (Formula presented.). Further increasing the (Formula presented.) the flow becomes spiral 0-VF with m = 4 and m = 5 spiral waves at (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) respectively. Increasing the (Formula presented.) further the flow finally becomes turbulent.

The behaviors of malware, such as malicious charges and privacy theft, pose serious security threats to users. Permission granting, as the primary security scheme of Android, is a prerequisite for performing dangerous operations on devices by invoking Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Besides, permission and hardware features are jointly declared in the manifest file of an application (app) to guarantee its device compatibility. Thus, we extract permissions, API calls and hardware features to characterize apps. Furthermore, we design a novel architectural unit, Multi-Head Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual block (MSer), to learn the intrinsic correlation between features and recalibrating them from multiple perspectives. Based on these two works, we propose a new malware detection framework MSerNetDroid.

However, the symmetry information is seldom directly stored in the native CAD models and never in the neutral exchange file formats. One way to retrieve the symmetry information is the visual recognition by the expert. However, for complex geometric shapes or a significant number of CAD models from the repository, the visual recognition may be complex, time-intensive, and often only approximative. Thus, to eliminate the need for visual recognition, computer-aided symmetry detection is preferred, which deals with the automatic identification of the planes and axes of symmetry. The present study proposes a vector-based approach using face centroids to detect exact reflection and axisymmetry in 3D CAD models with Boundary Representation (B-rep). The proposed approach has been implemented in a state-of-the-art CAD system using its Application Programming Interface and tested on 150 CAD models for validation purposes. The obtained results confirmed that the proposed approach enables accurate and efficient detection of the corresponding planes and axes of symmetry. © 2023 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net.","Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Interface states; Axisymmetry; Boundary representations; Computer aided design models; Computer-aided design; Exact symmetry; Plane-of-symmetry; Reflection symmetry; Symmetry detection; Visual recognition; Computer aided design","axisymmetry; B-rep; Computer-Aided Design (CAD); exact symmetry; reflection symmetry; symmetry detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146784605"

CAD systems have undergone enormous progress. They are becoming more and more intelligent and automated. However, those systems still need improvement and still have flaws that need to be corrected in order to improve and develop the productivity and efficiency of the design process. Mechanical products are often complex and composed of multiple components so, consequently, an Engineering Change (EC) that affects a module or a single component will certainly influence the rest of the assembly. This phenomenon is called Change Propagation (CP). Therefore, in order to propagate a change that affects an assembly component easily, it is important to predict the Change Propagation Path and the impact of this modification on the rest of the assembly components. Hence, CP becomes an easy task. This paper focuses on the risk assessment of an engineering change, in order to enhance the predictive capacity of engineering change management methods. In fact, a full analysis must be made to measure the real impact of such modifications as well as their feasibility. To this end, the authors proposed a matrix-based approach, which results in a Risk Matrix. This is the product of the Relationships Matrix and the Influences Matrix which are constructed based on the data extracted at an early stage. In fact, the CAD assembly model contains a lot of important information that is extracted using Application Programming Interface (API). © 2022","Application programming interfaces (API); Assembly; Computer aided design; Product design; Change propagation; Computer aided design models; Computer aided design systems; Engineering changes; Influence parameter; Interference matrix; Propagation probabilities; Propagation risk; Relationship matrix; Risks assessments; Risk assessment","CAD model; Influence Parameters; Interference matrix; Propagation probability; Propagation risk; Relationships Matrix","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129430911"

We developed and implemented a prototype in the Python programming language connecting to web services from Google Maps API (Directions, Maps JavaScript) to support the decision-making process in real-time and tested its performance.

In addition to traditional leukocyte quantification devices such as flow cytometers and benchtop fluorescent microscopes, smartphone-based particle quantifiers are becoming popular because they provide results at a fraction of the cost. One major limitation of these smartphone-based devices is their dependence on desktop computers for data processing, which keeps them from reaching their true translation potential as point of care (POC) devices. In this paper, we present a computer vision and machine learning-enabled methodology to count particles imaged from our 3D printed smartphone-coupled fluorescent microscope. Multiple convolution neural networks (CNN) using different filter sizes were implemented and trained with various learning rates (0.001, 0.0001) and batch sizes (8,16,32). The performance of these trained networks was then tested on green fluorescent microparticles and leukocytes and compared against the ground truth obtained using ImageJ. An R2 value of 0.99 was observed. Next, when cross-validation was done to validate the efficacy of the designed CNN architecture, and the predicted results showed a good correlation (R2 = 0.99) when compared against the ground truth. The performance of the trained model was also evaluated on particles conjugated with a different fluorophore and an R2 value of 0.99 was observed, showcasing its efficacy and versatility. This trained model was then integrated into an Application Programming Interface (API) and is available online for the broader community usage.  © 2013 IEEE.","3D printers; Application programming interfaces (API); Data handling; Diagnosis; Fluorescence; Image processing; Machine learning; mHealth; Personal computers; Convolution neural network; Disease diagnostics; Fluorescent microscopy; Images processing; Leucocyte counting; Leucocytes; Machine-learning; Performance; Point of care; Smart phones; Smartphones","Disease diagnostics; Fluorescent microscopy; Image processing; Leukocyte counting; Machine learning; Point-of-care","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137866315"

This work focuses on the main category (crypto-ransomware) of ransomware attacks, making the victim's data impossible to recover once it has been encrypted. It encrypts its victim's files with an encryption algorithm and tries to extort a ransom from the victim. To identify a crypto-ransomware attack at the pre-encryption level, the authors propose a Pre-Encryption and Identification Technique (PEI). Firstly, PEI provides early identification of ransomware. The detection stage uses a signature comparison against the signatures of known crypto-ransomware to detect ransomware before it can be triggered. For reliable file comparison, a Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA-256) signature was generated. Secondly, a detection stage based on a Learning Algorithm (L.A.) consisting of discretization and prediction using a random forest model finds crypto-ransomware through pre-encryption Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs pattern recognition helps the learning algorithm identify crypto-ransomware from suspicious programs.

However, the semi-analytical methods of near-fault broadband seismogram synthesis in the anisotropic medium are still rare. The physical-based frequency-wavenumber method was constructed for broadband seismogram synthesis due to a kinematic hybrid finite-fault source in a stratified transversely isotropic (TI) half-space for the first time. As the crucial foundation of the seismogram synthesis, the Green's function is established by the dynamic stiffness matrix method, effectively and stably modeling the broadband seismic waves propagation in a TI crust. A hybrid method of the kinematic fault source is applied to reasonably combine the low-frequency deterministic parts with the high-frequency stochastic parts, achieving a broadband waves excitation. The theoretical formulations are well-programmed by the FORTRAN code with OpenMP-based parallel technology to implement the fast solution. Compared with the two published results, the correctness of the methodology is well verified.

This mechanism makes the development of applications more convenient, but it also brings security issues. Applications that hide malicious behavior in the external file by dynamic code loading are becoming a new challenge for Android malware detection. To overcome this challenge, based on dynamic code loading mechanisms, three types of threat models, i.e. Model I, Model II, and Model III are defined. For the Model I type malware, its malicious behavior occurs in DexCode, so the application programming interface (API) classes were used to characterize the behavior of the DexCode file. For the Model II type and Model III type malwares whose malicious behaviors occur in an external file, the permission complement is defined to characterize the behaviors of the external file. Based on permission complement and API calls, an Android malicious application detection method is proposed, of which feature sets are constructed by improving a feature selection method. Five datasets containing 15,581 samples are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

The bottlenecking repetitive solution of the state equation has been solved using an optimized geometric multigrid approach along with CUDA parallelization enabling an order of magnitude faster in computational time than current state of the art implementations. The main novelty lies in the efficient implementation wherein on the fly computation of auxiliary matrices in the multigrid scheme and modification in interpolation schemes using homogenization strategy removes memory limitation of GPUs. Memory hierarchy of GPU has also been exploited for further optimized implementations. All these enable solution of structures involving hundred millions of three dimensional brick elements to be accomplished in a standard desktop computer or a workstation. Performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using several examples including design dependent loads. Results obtained indicate the excellent performance and scalability of the proposed approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computational efficiency; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Equations of state; MATLAB; Program processors; Topology; CUDA graphic processing unit acceleration; Efficient implementation; Homogenization; Hybrid topologies; Multi-threading capabilities; Multigrid approach; Multigrids; Optimization algorithms; Parallelization strategies; Topology optimisation; Graphics processing unit","CUDA GPU acceleration; Homogenization; MultiGrid; Topology optimization","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145196968"

Black-box testing, which assumes only the access to the system under test with a specific interface, is the only viable option when white-box testing is impracticable. This is the case for REST APIs: their source code is usually not (or just partially) available, or a white-box analysis across many dynamically allocated distributed components (typical of a micro-services architecture) is computationally challenging. This paper presents RestTestGen, a novel black-box approach to automatically generate test cases for REST APIs, based on their interface definition (an OpenAPI specification). Input values and requests are generated for each operation of the API under test with the twofold objective of testing nominal execution scenarios and error scenarios. Two distinct oracles are deployed to detect when test cases reveal implementation defects. While this approach is mainly targeting the research community, it is also of interest to developers because, as a black-box approach, it is universally applicable across different programming languages, or in the case external (compiled only) libraries are used in a REST API. The validation of our approach has been performed on more than 100 of real-world REST APIs, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach in revealing actual faults in already deployed services. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Architectural style; Black box approach; Distributed components; Representational state transfer; Source codes; Specific interface; Systems under tests; Test case; White box; White-box testing; Black-box testing","automatic test case generation; black-box testing; REST APIs; test oracle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123472911"

A graphical acoustic computing method combined with the shooting bouncing ray method (GRACO-SBR) is introduced to solve the acoustic target strength of complex underwater target with concave surfaces. The graphical acoustic computing (GRACO) is an asymptotic method based on physical acoustics. Aided with OpenGL 3D graphical rendering pipeline, this method can process the acoustic integration parallelly and efficiently. Since the traditional GRACO only considers the first-order scattering, the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) is compounded with the GRACO to cope with the higher-order scattering of concave structures. The target strength of an impedance sphere is solved with several different methods including the GRACO. The results show that the GRACO has an outstanding advantage of the efficiency over the finite element method (FEM) and the traditional Kirchhoff approximation at minor cost of the accuracy in high frequency range. Besides, the prediction of the backscattering of a dihedral corner reflector tells that the GRACO-SBR which considers the second-order scattering can acquire much more accurate solutions than the traditional GRACO method. Further, a stern with cross rudders is considered by both GRACO and GRACO-SBR, and the solutions show that the second-order scattering cannot be overlook when predicting the backscattering of concave structures. © 2022","Acoustic impedance; Acoustic wave scattering; Application programming interfaces (API); Backscattering; Three dimensional computer graphics; Underwater acoustics; Acoustic Scattering; Computing methods; Concave structures; Graphical acoustic computing; Kirchhoff approximations; Second order scattering; Shooting and bouncing rays; Strength prediction; Target strength; Underwater target; Forecasting","Acoustic scattering; Graphical acoustic computing; Kirchhoff approximation; Shooting and bouncing ray; Target strength","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139984825"

Despite the tremendous advantages of cloud computing, one big threat which must be taken care of is data security in the cloud. There are a dozen of threats that we are being exposed to while availing cloud services. Insufficient identity and access management, insecure interfaces and Applications interfaces (APIs), hijacking, advanced persistent threats, data threats, and many more are certain security issues with the cloud platform. APIs and service providers face a huge challenge to ensure the security and integrity of both network and data. To overcome these challenges access control mechanisms are employed. Traditional access control mechanisms fail to monitor the user operations on the cloud platform and are prone to attacks like IP spoofing and other attacks that impact the integrity of the data. For ensuring data integrity on cloud platforms, access control mechanisms should go beyond authentication, identification, and authorization. Thus, in this work, a trust-based access control mechanism is proposed that analyzes the data of the user behavior, network behavior, demand behavior, and security behavior for computing trust value before granting user access. The method that computes the final trust value makes use of the fuzzy logic algorithm. The trust value-based policies are defined for the access control mechanism and based on the trust value outcome the access control is granted or denied. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

As it majorly affects the common livelihood of people across the universe, it is essential for administrators and healthcare professionals to be aware of the views of the community so as to monitor the severity of the spread of the outbreak. The public opinions are been shared enormously in microblogging media like twitter and is considered as one of the popular sources to collect public opinions in any topic like politics, sports, entertainment etc., This work presents a combination of Intensity Based Emotion Classification Convolution Neural Network (IBEC-CNN) model and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for detecting and analyzing the different topics discussed in the COVID-19 tweets as well the intensity of the emotional content of those tweets. The topics were identified using NMF and the emotions are classified using pretrained IBEC-CNN, based on predefined intensity scores. The research aimed at identifying the emotions in the Indian tweets related to COVID-19 and producing a list of topics discussed by the users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Twitter Application Programming Interface (Twitter API), huge numbers of COVID-19 tweets are retrieved during January and July 2020. The extracted tweets are analyzed for emotions fear, joy, sadness and trust with proposed Intensity Based Emotion Classification Convolution Neural Network (IBEC-CNN) model which is pretrained. The classified tweets are given an intensity score varies from 1 to 3, with 1 being low intensity for the emotion, 2 being the moderate and 3 being the high intensity. To identify the topics in the tweets and the themes of those topics, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been employed. Analysis of emotions of COVID-19 tweets has identified, that the count of positive tweets is more than that of count of negative tweets during the period considered and the negative tweets related to COVID-19 is less than 5%. Also, more than 75% negative tweets expressed sadness, fear are of low intensity. A qualitative analysis has also been conducted and the topics detected are grouped into themes such as economic impacts, case reports, treatments, entertainment and vaccination. The results of analysis show that the issues related to the pandemic are expressed different emotions in twitter which helps in interpreting the public insights during the pandemic and these results are beneficial for planning the dissemination of factual health statistics to build the trust of the people. The performance comparison shows that the proposed IBEC-CNN model outperforms the conventional models and achieved 83.71% accuracy. The % of COVID-19 tweets that discussed the different topics vary from 7.45% to 26.43% on topics economy, Statistics on cases, Government/Politics, Entertainment, Lockdown, Treatments and Virtual Events.

The designed numerical model introduces a dynamic disturbance in the vicinity of the wall in addition to the distribution of triangular roughness elements in the body using the panel method, consolidating a refined boundary layer condition. A new discretization strategy for the vorticity field is used to make up a wide range of Reynolds numbers, 2 × 10 4≤ Re ≤ 6 × 10 5, which also ensures control of turbulence. It is integrated with the discrete vortex method—DVM and the second-order velocity structure function is applied for turbulence closure. The main findings are that numerically the drag coefficient depends on the relative roughness, the Reynolds number and the cutoff width of the characteristic vorticity distribution; the largest reductions in drag are observed for intermediate roughness compared to a smooth surface, reaching 51.6% for a relative roughness of 0.003 and Reynolds number set at 1.0 × 10 5; the core sizes of the discrete vortex need to be generated with different sizes for correct enforcement of the wall influence; it is possible to map the drag crisis under various flow conditions in cylinders with different surfaces, without the use of refined meshes and wall functions, using the DVM. OpenMP is implemented for average reductions of 80% in processing time. The considerable closeness with the experimental results reflects the applicability of the proposed method and the relevance of the two-dimensional approach for predicting unsteady aerodynamic forces on a cylinder with different rough surfaces for engineering purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Application programming interfaces (API); Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Circular cylinders; Drag; Lagrange multipliers; Numerical methods; Reynolds number; Surface roughness; Turbulence; Vortex flow; Vorticity; % reductions; Discretizations; Lagrangian; Large-eddy simulations; Openmp; Reynold number; Roughness models; Roughness model—MLDRVL; Vortex-shedding; Vorticity discretization; Large eddy simulation","Drag reduction; Large eddy simulation; OpenMP; Roughness model—MLDR<sub>VL</sub>; Vortex shedding; Vorticity discretization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133926355"

The user-level protocols are complex and require specific persistence properties of file systems for correctness. If the kernel provides transactional access to file data, application developers can avoid the complex and error-prone application-level protocols. Many previous studies on kernel-level transactional support have several critical limitations such as complex APIs, file system-dependence, and low transaction concurrency. In this paper, we propose a kernel-level write-ahead logging (WAL) technique, called KWAL. KWAL maintains user-transparent WAL files and redirects transactional IOs to them. Since KWAL is implemented as a stackable file system, it can be mounted over any native file systems, without modifying them. To provide a higher transaction concurrency while guaranteeing isolation, KWAL supports byte-level write conflict detection and repeatable read isolation. We also utilize a block remap technique to resolve the duplicate write problem of WAL-based transaction scheme. To demonstrate the usefulness of KWAL, we implemented a simple key-value store using KWAL APIs, fixed the wrong transaction implementation of the Git application, and simplified the implementation of the storage engines of MySQL and SQLite.  © 2013 IEEE.","File organization; Isotopes; Virtual storage; Computer crashes; Concurrency; Concurrent computing; Filesystem; Kernel; Stackable file system; Transactional file system; Write ahead loggings; Write-ahead log; Application programming interfaces (API)","concurrency; stackable file system; Transactional file system; write-ahead log","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140747621"

In this work we provide an in-depth study of six state-of-the-art GPGPU APIs. From these we derive a taxonomy of the common semantics and propose a unified specification. We describe a methodology to translate this unified specification into different target APIs. This simplifies cross-platform application development and provides a clean framework for benchmarking. Our proposed unified specification is called GPGPU unified specification and translation (GUST) and it captures common functionality found in compute-only APIs (e.g., compute unified device architecture and open computing language), in the compute pipeline of traditional graphic-oriented APIs (e.g., open graphic language and Direct3D11) and in last-generation bare-metal APIs (e.g., Vulkan and Direct3D12).

There is a need to understand the crack branching mechanism for enhancing the unconventional resource production. In the present manuscript, the dynamic fluid-driven fracture branching in saturated porous media is studied by a parallel PD-FEM coupling approach. Under the assumption of negligible relative acceleration of the fluid with respect to the mixture, the two-field u-p model is derived based on the Biot's theory. The dynamic coupled system is discretized into two layers with the non-ordinary state-based peridynamics layer characterizing the deformation and fracture of the solid skeleton and finite element layer representing the fluid flow. A fully implicit scheme for the time integration of the dynamic coupled system within a nonlinear framework based on the Newmark method is employed and an alternate grid/particle updating OpenMP parallel programming scheme is proposed. The efficiency and accuracy of the coupled method is first verified by several benchmark examples with either experimental data or analytical solutions, followed by a study of crucial factors affecting dynamic hydraulic fracturing branching. The parametric study shows that in general the following factors favor the crack branching: lower critical energy release rate, higher injection rate, lower Young's modulus, higher Poisson's ratio, lower viscosity of the fluid and higher compressibility of the fluid. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Cracks; Elastic moduli; Finite element method; Flow of fluids; Hydraulic fracturing; Parallel programming; Porous materials; Coupled systems; Crack branching; Dynamic fluids; Dynamic hydraulic fracture; FEM simulations; Fracture propagation; Openmp; Peridynamics; Porous medium; Saturated porous media; Fracture","Coupling; Dynamic hydraulic fracture; Fracture propagation; OpenMp; Peridynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138092067"

As for today, most colorimetric sensors are read by a smartphone or professional optical imaging system, and there is still a lack of an affordable and reliable colorimetric detector for the microfluidic chip. Integrating those reading and detection capabilities into a microfluidic system is essential for point-of-care (POC) detection and can enable more complex microfluidic operations, such as lab-on-a-chip experiments or programmable microfluidics. We developed an open-source colorimetric detection sensor board that can be integrated into the existing microfluidic system. This sensor board has a built-in UV source that enables fluorescence detection. With built-in USB and Wi-Fi connectivity and a set of simple APIs, microfluidic systems can communicate directly with this sensor board, even wirelessly. The sensor was designed for low-cost. With a total build cost of less than 12 EUR per unit, it is ideal for low-cost systems and DIY microfluidic users. Along with the sensor board, we also designed a companion microfluidic chip carrier cartridge which can be modified depending on the chip's dimension.

Here, automated, high-throughput experiments are demonstrated for interdisciplinary research in life science that can be replicated on a modest budget, using open tools to ensure reproducibility by combining the tools OpenFlexure, Opentrons, ImJoy, and UC2. This automated sample preparation and imaging pipeline can easily be replicated and established in many laboratories as well as in educational contexts through easy-to-understand algorithms and easy-to-build microscopes. Additionally, the creation of feedback loops, with later pipetting or imaging steps depending on the analysis of previously acquired images, enables the realization of fully autonomous “smart” microscopy experiments. All documents and source files are publicly available to prove the concept of smart lab automation using inexpensive, open tools. It is believed this democratizes access to the power and repeatability of automated experiments. © 2021 The Authors.

Rotational periods play an important role in elucidating the characteristics of asteroids, such as the rubble-pile internal structure and the spin barrier. Generally, commonly used periodogram methods, such as Fourier-type methods, can produce only a rough estimate of the rotational period, and it is difficult to obtain other essential parameters, such as the pole, shape, and scattering parameters. To alleviate this problem, this article presents a three-step reduced voting (TRV) algorithm based on the Cellinoid model to accurately and efficiently invert asteroidal periods from lightcurves. The proposed TRV algorithm can realize this inversion process to derive the high-precision period, as well as a roughly estimated pole orientation and overall shape of an asteroid. Numerical experiments confirm that the TRV algorithm can obtain accurate periods and near-accurate poles from synthetic lightcurves. Besides, this algorithm is applied to invert the rotational periods of the 61 real asteroids, and the derived periods are consistent with those reported in other publications. It is also demonstrated that more observations collected in various viewing geometries can improve the accuracy in searching the pole orientation of an asteroid. For further improving the efficiency of TRV, parallel versions of this algorithm implemented with OpenMP and CUDA C schemes are provided with environments of Hygon C86 7185 CPUs and a Tesla V100-SXM3 GPU, respectively. The maximum speedup ratio of the OpenMP scheme is 79.567x, while that of the CUDA C scheme is 110.906x. The results show that the proposed parallel acceleration schemes can greatly improve the inversion efficiency of the TRV algorithm, and can be widely used in searching the parameters of a large number of asteroids. © 2022 COSPAR","Acceleration; Application programming interfaces (API); Earth (planet); Efficiency; Interplanetary flight; Lunar missions; Piles; Poles; Program processors; Space research; Asteroid lightcurve; Cellinoid shape model; Deep-space exploration; Lightcurves; Parallel accelerated search; Parameters inversion; Physical parameter inversion; Physical parameters; Shape Modelling; Voting algorithm; Asteroids","Asteroid lightcurve; Cellinoid shape model; Deep space exploration; Parallel accelerated search; Physical parameter inversion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148751441"

The FEM solver is divided into five major sections; these are a collection of mesh data, creating an object for each finite element, application of boundary conditions, assembly of a linear system of equations, and lastly a solver to calculate the solution for the system of linear equations. This work has focused on the study of multiple parallel implementations for each stage of the FEM solver. All the stages are implemented in C++ while each stage parallel regions are implemented using OpenMP. The data structures used in this work are also C++ objects implemented using STL containers, like sparse matrix used is constructed as two-layer nested binary trees where each internal tree represents a sparse row in a global matrix. These structures are used in every stage and have never been converted into more conventional matrix structures like CSR, etc. Finally, this work has shown the contribution of time for each stage and the amount of speedup achieved for them. Using 16 threads, the solver has attained a speedup of 5.21 for mesh having 2099201 unknowns and Poisson's equation. Two linear solvers Jacobi and CG are used which were consuming 95% of total solver time.

However, to be able to use them in hard real-time systems, timing guarantees need to be provided, and the main challenge is to determine the worst-case schedule length (also known as makespan) of an application.

On the other hand, the directed acyclic graph (DAG) application model and the unrelated multiprocessor model are general and can cover most of today’s platforms and applications.

A set of representative OpenMP task-based parallel applications from the BOTS benchmark suite and synthetic DAGs are used to evaluate the proposed method.

System verification on a testbed is required to deploy IoT applications in production environments. In a testbed, Docker containers are preferable for a smooth transition of tested application programs to production environments. In addition, the round-trip times (RTT) of Docker containers to clients must be ensured, according to the target application's response time requirements. However, in existing testbed systems, the RTTs between Docker containers and clients are not ensured. Thus, we must undergo a large amount of configuration data including RTTs between all pairs of wireless base station nodes and servers to set up a testbed environment. In this paper, we present an edge computing testbed system with simple application programming interfaces (API) for testbed users that ensures RTTs between Docker containers and clients. The proposed system automatically determines which servers to place Docker containers on according to virtual regions and the RTTs specified by the testbed users through APIs. The virtual regions provide reduced size information about the RTTs in a network. In the proposed system, the configuration data size is reduced to one divided by the number of the servers and the command arguments length is reduced to approximately one-third or less, whereas the increased system running time is 4.3 s.  © 2022 The Institute of Electronics.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Containers; Internet of things; Testbeds; Computing infrastructures; Design and implementations; Edge computing; Efficient bandwidth; Experimental environment; Kubernetes; Low response time; Production environments; Test bed systems; Time bandwidths; Edge computing","edge computing; Kubernetes; low response time; testbed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138470182"

Unfortunately, tools detecting potential side-channel vulnerabilities within applications are limited and usually ignore the strong attack model and the unique programming model imposed by Intel SGX. This paper proposes a precise side-channel analysis tool, ENCIDER, detecting both timing and cache side-channel vulnerabilities within SGX applications via inferring potential timing observation points and incorporating the SGX programming model into analysis. ENCIDER uses dynamic symbolic execution to decompose the side-channel requirement based on the bounded non-interference property and implements byte-level information flow tracking via API modeling. We have applied ENCIDER to 4 real-world SGX applications, 2 SGX crypto libraries, and 3 widely-used crypto libraries, and found 29 timing side channels and 73 code and data cache side channels. We have reported our findings to the corresponding parties, e.g., Intel and ARM, who have confirmed most of the vulnerabilities detected.

Establishing a harmonious human–computer interaction environment in the multidimensional information space is one of the development goals of information technology. Face information is important information for identifying the identity of others. Three-dimensional information has important applications in many fields and directions of machine vision. Therefore, the three-dimensional common face image has a significant meaning. In this paper, binocular stereo vision system is used to collect multiple pairs of facial information images. The image correction method was used to correct the collected image pairs. According to the basic criteria of stereo matching, the advantages and disadvantages of various traditional image matching methods are analyzed. On the basis of completing the image correction, the graph cut matching method is selected as the matching method, and multiple pairs of collected image pairs are matched by this method to obtain a multi-angle face disparity map. In this paper, after studying the basic dense matching algorithm and its improved algorithm, the SAD, SD, and NC methods of fixed window are used to compare the matching cost and the performance of the adaptive weight method in face matching.

This project aims to demystify the development of neuro-musculoskeletal modeling in OpenSim with zero configuration on any operating system for installation (thus cross-platform), easy to share models while accessing free graphical processing units (GPUs) on a web-based platform of Google Colab. To achieve this, OpenColab was developed where OpenSim source code was used to build a Conda package that can be installed on the Google Colab with only one block of code in less than 7 min. To use OpenColab, one requires a connection to the internet and a Gmail account. Moreover, OpenColab accesses vast libraries of machine learning methods available within free Google products, e.g. TensorFlow. Next, we performed an inverse problem in biomechanics and compared OpenColab results with OpenSim graphical user interface (GUI) for validation.

This rise of the usage of smartphones generally, and the Android system specifically, leads to a strong need to effectively secure Android, as the malware developers are targeting it with sophisticated and obfuscated malware applications. Consequently, a lot of studies were performed to propose a robust method to detect and classify android malicious software (malware). Some of them were effective, some were not; with accuracy below 90%, and some of them are being outdated; using datasets that became old containing applications for old versions of Android that are rarely used today. In this paper, a new method is proposed by using static analysis and gathering as most useful features of android applications as possible, along with two new proposed features, and then passing them to a functional API deep learning model we made. This method was implemented on a new and classified android application dataset, using 14079 malware and benign samples in total, with malware samples classified into four malware classes. Two major experiments with this dataset were implemented, one for malware detection with the dataset samples categorized into two classes as just malware and benign, the second one was made for malware detection and classification, using all the five classes of the dataset. As a result, our model overcomes the related works when using just two classes with F1-score of 99.5%. Also, high malware detection and classification performance was obtained by using the five classes, with F1-score of 97%.  © 2013 IEEE.","Android (operating system); Android malware; Application programming interfaces (API); Classification (of information); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Smartphones; Static analysis; Android; Code; Deep learning; Features extraction; Malwares; Operating system; Smart phones; Mobile security","Android; deep learning; malware; mobile security; static analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141617152"

The expansion of subway networks has given people more route choices and increased the appeal of online maps for route selection. Since few studies have investigated route choices across the entire transport network based on online maps, we introduce the concept of parallel routes with a network analysis approach. Based on that, we offer a comparative analysis between the Beijing and Shanghai subway networks with a network analysis approach combining an online map application programming interface (API). Moreover, we investigate to what extent route choices by subway can be explained by built environment factors within the metro station buffer. The results indicate that online maps do not always offer reasonable route choices due to the complex topology of subway networks. Empirical analysis shows that route choices of the Beijing and Shanghai subway networks follow a distance decay law: the closer to the city center the metro station, the more parallel the routes. Compared with Beijing, the subway network in Shanghai provides more route choices within more parallel routes within the same distance. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between route choices and land-use mixture around metro stations.

This paper presents the application of the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify the top 4 most popular Iranian pistachio cultivars, including ‘Fandoghi’, ‘Kaleh-Ghouchi’, ‘Ahmad-Aghaei’, and ‘Akbari’. An image dataset was collected by acquiring pistachio samples images in the bulk mode under the condition of placing perpendicular to the camera with a fixed distance and natural lightening. The feature extraction block of EfficientNet-B3 was combined with a custom classification block. The proposed model was fine-tuned using the pistachio image dataset and adjusted to identify the various cultivars. The pistachio identification system was implemented using Python programming and the Keras API with TensorFlow Machine Learning framework. The results show that the classification accuracy of the best model evaluated on a hold-out test dataset is 98.00%. On the other hand, the proposed CNN model using EfficientNet-B3 presents average precision, recall, and F1-score values of 96.73%, 96.70%, and 96.67%, respectively.

Owing to the reality that a heart attack will happen without notice, an insightful screening system is inevitable. This paper investigates a new CHD detection approach built on an optimization machine learning technique, such as classifier ensembles. To boost the efficiency of our system, we used the Feature-Selector optimization model to select the best subset of CHD features. Second, to solve the problem of imbalanced CHD data, we used optimized SMOTE over-sampling, a highly efficient approach embedded with an optimization model. The class label estimation of three optimization learners, namely random forest, XGBoost API optimization, and SVM optimization model, is integrated in a stacked architecture. The identification model is validated using data from CHD patients. Finally, in terms of precision, F1, and ROC-Curve, our detection model outperformed existing ones focused on optimization models ensembles and individual classifiers. With random forest optimization, we achieved 90% accuracy, and with the XGBoost API optimization model, we achieved 89% accuracy.

It can effectively protect user information from the attack of malicious developers. Existing studies mainly focus on leveraging permission information and API call information to identify malware. However, many studies pay attention to the API call without considering the role of API call sequences. In this study, we propose a new method by combining both the permission information and the API call sequence information to distinguish malicious applications from benign applications. First, we extract features of permission and API call sequence with a decompiling tool. Then, one-hot encoding and Word2Vec are adopted to represent the permission feature and the API call sequence feature for each application, respectively. Based on this, we leverage Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a permission-based classifier and an API call sequence-based classifier, respectively. Finally, we design a linear strategy to combine the outputs of these two classifiers to predict the labels of newly arrived applications. By an evaluation with 15,198 malicious applications and 15,129 benign applications, our approach achieves 98.84% in terms of precision, 98.17% in terms of recall, 98.50% in terms of F1-score, and 98.52% in terms of accuracy on average, and outperforms the state-of-art method Malscan by 2.12%, 0.27%, 1.20%, and 1.24%, respectively.

In general, the conventional mass-spring system is manipulated as a force-driven method because it is fast, simple to implement, and the parameters can be controlled. However, the springs in traditional mass-spring system can be excessively elongated which cause severe stability and robustness issues that lead to shape restoring, simulation blow-up, and huge volume loss of the deformable object. In addition, traditional method that uses a serial process of the central processing unit (CPU) to solve the system in every frame cannot handle the complex structure of deformable object in real-time. Therefore, the first order implicit constraint enforcement for a mass-spring model is utilized to achieve accurate visual realism of deformable objects with tough constraint error. In this paper, we applied the distance constraint and volume conservation constraints for each tetrahedron element to improve the stability of deformable object simulation using the mass-spring system and behave the same as its real-world counterparts. To reduce the computational complexity while ensuring stable simulation, we applied a method that utilizes OpenGL compute shader, a part of OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) that executes on the graphic processing unit (GPU) to solve the numerical problems effectively. We applied the proposed methods to experimental volumetric models, and volume percentages of all objects are compared. The average volume percentages of all models during the simulation using the mass-spring system, distance constraint, and the volume constraint method were 68.21%, 89.64%, and 98.70%, respectively. The proposed approaches are successfully applied to improve the stability of mass-spring system and the performance comparison from our experimental tests also shows that the GPU-based method is faster than CPU-based implementation for all cases. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, when the data increases to 104 orders of magnitude, the rate of accuracy decline meets an inflection point and finally stabilizes to about 96.8% in the environment of 132457 data of monk model. The point cloud hole-filling algorithm based on the optimal neural network given in this article is highly predictable, can well repair incomplete point cloud holes, has good repair effect on point cloud holes, and can obtain high acceleration ratio, which can provide reference for practical engineering application.  © 2022 Siyong Fu.","Filling; Repair; Aggregation algorithms; Algorithm researches; Cloud data; Cloud networks; Hole filling algorithm; Neural-networks; Optimal neural network; Point cloud data; Point-clouds; Repair efficiencies; Application programming interfaces (API)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130547830"

Several applications make use of these calculations, from fuel assembly to full core design, criticality and safety, needing consistency check of the geometry and input properties before starting any lattice calculation. The software pattern design of the GUIs is briefly discussed, showing also the rationale behind the two interfaces for the construction of the geometries for simple fuel assemblies and complex motifs including the reflector (colorsets). The new GUI, ALAMOS, specifically developed for APOLLO3® with a Python Application Programming Interface (API), is here presented as the successor of Silène, which was the first GUI released in the 1990s to serve APOLLO2 calculations.

This WCSPH model was developed based on the δ-LES-SPH method according to the characteristics of landslide-tsunamis. In this model, a modified coupled dynamic boundary method was proposed to mimic (in a uniform manner) the solid wall boundary of the fluid and the dynamic friction boundary of the slide, which expands the range of application of the δ-LES-SPH method. A particle shifting technique (PST) was introduced to improve the accuracy and robustness of the δ-LES-SPH method. The Fortran 90 language was used to implement the current SPH code, and OpenMP programming was adopted to improve the computing efficiency. Afterwards, the current procedure was utilized to model subaerial and submarine single-block rigid landslides and submarine multi-block landslides. Firstly, the SPH results of the slide movements, wave profiles and energy were compared with the experimental data and previous numerical results. Then, the energy equation is used to study the energy components of different types of landslide-tsunamis. Energy analysis reveals that the more complex the movement of the slide, the lower the efficiency of energy transfer. The consistency between the numerical results and the experimental data confirms the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method. The current model provides a useful tool to study the problem of tsunamis generated by rigid landslides. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Energy management; Energy transfer; Numerical methods; Submarine geology; Submarines; Tsunamis; Boundary method; Coupled dynamics; Dynamic boundary; Energy analysis; Landslide tsunamis; Modified coupled dynamic boundary method; Particle shifting technique; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics modeling; SPH methods; Weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamic model; disaster management; dynamic analysis; experimental study; hydrodynamic force; landslide; model test; tsunami; Landslides","Energy analysis; Landslide-tsunamis; Modified coupled dynamic boundary method; Particle shifting technique; WCSPH model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122330733"

While applications concerning the seismic vulnerability of existing RC buildings have been largely proposed in literature, the evaluation of the structural vulnerability because of hazards different from earthquake has been less dealt with. The focus of this work is to estimate the probability that the simulated RC buildings stock could reach a given Limit State for a certain intensity of imposed monotonically increasing ground differential settlements. A set of simulated FEM models, considering the geometrical and mechanical uncertainties in the representation of the existing RC frame buildings designed only for gravitational loads, has been created. The structural frames differ from each other for geometrical features and mechanical materials properties, obtained through a simulation process. The non-linear behavior of columns and beams is considered by applying a modeling approach specifically elaborated for RC members with plain bars. A FEM model for each simulated structural frame has been developed using the Open Application Programming Interface by using the programming and numeric computing platform MATLAB to run the modelling software SAP2000. Time by time, by scaling up the amplitude of the imposed base displacements, a non-linear static incremental procedure has been implemented. At each step of the analysis, a code-based seismic safety assessment has been carried out with reference to a specific ultimate Limit State considered in the Italian and European codes. The goal of the analysis has been to find the values of the significative structural response parameters (identified in this work as the maximum differential settlement and the deflection ratio) at the onset of the selected Limit State by using the critical demand to capacity ratio. Considering that these values are lognormally distributed, the structural fragility is then derived, showing how the vulnerability of the considered RC buildings stock is affected by the impact of the geometrical features and by the application direction of the differential settlements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Europe; Italy; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Earthquakes; Geometry; Materials properties; MATLAB; Reinforced concrete; Structural analysis; Differential settlement; Existing reinforced concrete; Existing reinforced concrete building; Fragility curves; Incremental analysis; Latin hypercube sampling; Limit state; OAPI; Reinforced concrete buildings; SAP-matlab integration; building; building code; computer simulation; earthquake engineering; ground settlement; literature review; numerical model; reinforced concrete; seismic response; structural analysis; structural response; Concrete buildings","Differential settlements; Existing RC buildings; Fragility curves; Incremental Analysis; Latin Hypercube Sampling; OAPI; SAP-Matlab integration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125596523"

Combining different programming paradigms, such as Message Passing Interface (MPI), Open Multiple Processing (OpenMP), and Open Accelerators (OpenACC), can increase computation speed and improve performance. During the integration of multiple models, the probability of runtime errors increases, making their detection difficult, especially in the absence of testing techniques that can detect these errors. Numerous studies have been conducted to identify these errors, but no technique exists for detecting errors in three-level programming models. Despite the increasing research that integrates the three programming models, MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC, a testing technology to detect runtime errors, such as deadlocks and race conditions, which can arise from this integration has not been developed. Therefore, this paper begins with a definition and explanation of runtime errors that result from integrating the three programming models that compilers cannot detect. For the first time, this paper presents a classification of operational errors that can result from the integration of the three models. This paper also proposes a parallel hybrid testing technique for detecting runtime errors in systems built in the C++ programming language that uses the triple programming models MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC. This hybrid technology combines static technology and dynamic technology, given that some errors can be detected using static techniques, whereas others can be detected using dynamic technology. The hybrid technique can detect more errors because it combines two distinct technologies. The proposed static technology detects a wide range of error types in less time, whereas a portion of the potential errors that may or may not occur depending on the operating environment are left to the dynamic technology, which completes the validation. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

The use of Web APIs has played an important role in applications development and mashups creation, but it takes a lot of time to find a suitable Web API. In this paper, we propose to employ APIs recommendation to solve this problem. We use the matrix factorization (MF) model to predict the relationship between user and Web APIs. The relationship between user and Web APIs is represented by latent features. But different from MF model, we find that the relationship between Web APIs have an impact on prediction performance. This paper uses the embedding technique and mines the latent relationships between APIs and we develop a novel prediction model that leverages the latent relationships between APIs, which is named as LRM (LRM is short for latent relationships mining). The latent relations are input into the LRM model to produce the relation prediction between APIs and developers.

The objective has been to identify methods that promote evolution from file-based formats by advancing object-based data exchange solutions. The research design is a mapping of standards and systems that have affected the nature of object-based data exchanges, and which have either been proposed or implemented in AECO and the Oil & Gas sector. This is an approach which allows for the range and diversity of information to be examined. A review of the Oil & Gas sector confirms a norm where object-based, rather than file-based, transactions have shaped data exchange models, formats, use case methodologies, and collaboration mechanisms, thus contributing towards semantic connectivity across its diverse systems. Key research questions address the nature of these sectors, the promise that object-based data exchange offers, and examine recommendations that would improve standards and systems. The paper affirms that measures taken to improve interoperability in the Oil & Gas sector have relevance for the AECO sector, and that better understanding, and recognition of the structure of AECOs interoperability ecosystem is central to effecting lasting and significant change. Thus, we make recommendations that acknowledge the hybrid nature of AECO data exchanges and propose an interoperability ecosystem that connects both distributed and centralised federated models. Improved standards to define application programming interfaces (APIs) and adaptors, based on a modular approach, would be central to this proposal. We also make recommendations to improve use case definitions, and to ensure that semantic connectivity at the object level is scalable to web-based transactions. Finally, we assert that, to realise these changes, the developers and vendors of its systems should recognise and address the AECO sector’s pressing needs and concerns. 2022 The author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Ecosystems; Electronic data interchange; Gas industry; Life cycle; Semantics; Architecture engineering; Engineering constructions; Engineering operation; Gas sector; Object based; Objects-based; Oil gas; Oil sectors; Semantic connectivity; Transaction; Interoperability","Data exchange; Interoperability; Object-based; Semantic connectivity; Transactions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133538266"

This paper proposes a massively parallel implementation scheme for PD simulations with a single-card Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to reduce the computational cost. The GPU parallel scheme includes two-level parallel modes of particle-mapping and bond-mapping, realizing high parallelism. By reasonably setting the data structure and using the CUDA memory model, realize the efficient utilization of GPU memory resources. Three numerical experiments involving quasi-static and transient problems, 2D and 3D problems, and impact problems are performed. The results show that the proposed parallel scheme can greatly improve the computational efficiency of various PD models while ensuring accuracy.

To bypass defence mechanisms, the attackers obfuscate malware in multiple ways. Information-concealing techniques are used by hackers to bypass the existing defence mechanisms, thereby causing service disruption, loss of control, data loss, or modification of sensitive data in the cloud. This paper proposes a Stegware Neutralization model that aims to build a ubiquitous mechanism to readily counter hidden information attacks, irrespective of the obfuscation techniques used. The proposed system functions in three main phases: Steganalysis phase, Location finder and Neutralization phase. In the Steganalysis phase, the presence of obfuscated items hidden inside the digital medium is identified, while the location finder spots the exact location of the hidden payloads. In the Neutralization phase, location of the hidden item is neutralized by using nonlinear transfer function. The effectiveness of the proposed system is tested by analysing different image files obtained from the benchmarked database sources while checking for obfuscated malicious codes. A subset of the latest malware codes is collected from business Application Programming Interfaces (API) like VirusTotal. The experimental results show that the proposed system obtains higher accuracy rate in detecting malware i.e., ranging from 90% to 96% at different embedding rates (10% to 50%) as compared to the existing systems. Moreover, the proposed system firmly neutralizes the detected hidden malware. In fact, 97% of stegoimages are neutralized on an average by the proposed system. Also, the image files retain their original quality even after undergoing neutralization, showing hardly any perceptible change, almost missing the naked eye. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Cloud security; Cybersecurity; Location; Personal computing; Steganography; Transfer functions; Cloud securities; Defence mechanisms; Hidden information; matrix; Matrix-quadtree; Neutralisation; Nonlinear transfer functions; Quad trees; Stego image; Stegware; Malware","Cloud security; Matrix-Quadtrees; Neutralization; Nonlinear transfer function; StegoImages; Stegware","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129304899"

Nevertheless, there are still major challenges to efficiently applying them in order to optimise productivity. Some of them are addressed in this article, concretely, with respect to the adequate management of information technology (IT) infrastructures for automated analysis processes in critical fields such as the mining industry. In this area, this paper presents a tool called Pangea aimed at automatically generating suitable execution environments for deploying analytic pipelines. These pipelines are decomposed into various steps to execute each one in the most suitable environment (edge, fog, cloud or on-premise) minimising latency and optimising the use of both hardware and software resources. Pangea is focused in three distinct objectives: (1) generating the required infrastructure if it does not previously exist; (2) provisioning it with the necessary requirements to run the pipelines (i.e., configuring each host operative system and software, install dependencies and download the code to execute); and (3) deploying the pipelines. In order to facilitate the use of the architecture, a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API) is defined to interact with it. Therefore, in turn, a web client is proposed. Finally, it is worth noting that in addition to the production mode, a local development environment can be generated for testing and benchmarking purposes. © 2022 by the authors.

Ethernet connection was used to exchange system data and the communication delay is less than 10 ms. The other is to improve the robot operation efficiency. Because of the joystick’s unique operation mode, the robot motion operation can be realized efficiently and reliably through a joystick as an external input device of ROS.

The multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) is utilized to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) particle fields, and cross-correlation with fast Fourier transform is used to generate the displacement vectors. The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) C programming model is used to port the velocity field reconstruction from CPU code to GPU code to improve efficiency. For similar reconstruction tasks, a particular thread grid hierarchy is designed to construct the corresponding computational kernel functions, and each task is launched in a single thread. A modified strategy of pixel batch processing is then used to manage the GPU memory access. Subsequently, the asynchronous stream concurrency is used to generate the velocity field with the GPU cuFFT library. A synthetic 3D experiment with a ring vortex is carried out to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the developed method. The parallel results agree well with the generated data and other research conclusions reported in the literature. The speed-up ratio by multi-core CPU (Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8168) parallel implementation with OpenMP converges to 2.5 × in MFG-MART and 3.0 × in cross-correlation. In contrast to a 24-core CPU implementation, a GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100S, 32 GB) under maximum memory usage achieves an impressive speed-up ratio of over 20 × in parallel MFG-MART and 4 × in concurrent cross-correlation. The measurement of turbulent flow in a circular jet flow at Reynolds 3,000 is used to examine the efficiency promotion of the parallelized framework in real experimental settings. For the synthetic volume reconstruction of 700 × 700 × 140 voxels and cross-correlation with 413 voxels window in a 75% overlap, and the experimental volume reconstruction of 550 × 1100 × 550 voxels and cross-correlation with 323 voxels window in a 50% overlap, a frame of velocity field can be completed within 2 min in each domain.

Such dense and different data also lead to information garbage. Analyzing this dump with traditional technologies has been another problem. Big companies that are interested to analyze this mass information, analyze the behavior of their customers, and determine their strategies according to the results obtained have come up with the concept of big data. Big data are the form of the data we obtain from different sources such as social media shares, sensor data, photo archives, call records obtained from Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) operators, and search engine statistics, into a meaningful and processable form [1]. In this study, the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which is an important problem of today, on Istanbul traffic has been examined by using the power of big data technologies. In this context, the hourly traffic index of the 2020 dataset which has openly been published by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality [2], and the curfew time dataset is discussed. Apache Spark, a new generation data processing tool, has been used in the analysis of these datasets. With Apache Spark, first, general analysis of the Istanbul traffic index data for 2020 has been carried out, and then, the data obtained have been checked whether it is associated with the curfew time dataset and impact analysis has been performed. Elasticsearch has been utilized to keep the processed data, and Kibana has been used for data visualization.

Users can easily request a ride through a smartphone app that informs them of the pickup time, the location of the vehicle, and the fare that they will pay in advance. Even though it is well known that Uber implements a dynamic pricing approach depending mostly on supply, demand and competition with other services, there is still little empirical evidence on the main drivers explaining the fare strategy of the company. However, a deeper understanding of prices is essential to evaluate and establish a future scenario with smarter regulation and fairer competition between ridesourcing and taxi services. Using 10-month data from the Uber’s application programming interface in the city of Madrid, this research studies the association of Uber fares with different explanatory variables. It also explores the main differences between Uber and taxi fares. The results indicate that trip distance, trip delay, day of the week, origin and destination of the trip, and rain precipitation have a statistically significant impact on Uber fares. The findings also show that on average, Uber fares are lower than taxi fares, with the exception of particular hours of the day, as well as Uber fares slightly increased during taxi strikes recently happened in Madrid.

The proposed system obtained 99% accuracy, 97% sensitivity, and 99% specificity, showing that the CV system is a promising technology to assist the definition of the grasp pattern in prosthetic devices.

With this scale comes high demands on support staff for help in dealing with general questions relating to qualifications and registration. Chatbots that implement Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) can be a valuable part in this support process. A chatbot can provide constant availability in answering common questions, allowing support staff to engage on higher value one-to-one communication with prospective students. A variety of approaches can be used to create these chatbots including vertical platforms, frameworks, and direct model implementation. A comparative analysis is required to establish which approach provides the most accuracy for an existing, available dataset. This paper compares intent classification results of two popular chatbot frameworks to a state-of-the-art Sentence BERT (SBERT) model that can be used to build a robust chatbot. A methodology is outlined which includes the preparation of a university FAQ dataset into a chatbot friendly format for upload and training of each implementation. Results obtained from the framework-based implementations are generated using their published Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This enables intent classification using testing phrases and finally comparison of F1 scores. Using ten intents comprising 284 training phrases and 85 testing phrases it was found that a SBERT model outperformed all others with an F1-score of 0.99. Initial comparison with the literature suggests that the F1-scores obtained for Google Dialogflow (0.96) and Microsoft QnA Maker (0.95) are very similar to other benchmarking exercises where NLU (Natural Language Understanding) has been compared. © 2022 The Authors","Application programming interfaces (API); E-learning; Academic institutions; Chatbots; F1 scores; Frequently asked questions; Natural language understanding; Online learning; Sentence BERT; State of the art; Student numbers; Support staff; Students","Chatbots; FAQs; Natural language understanding; Online learning; SBERT","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145973734"

Existing models lack sufficient accuracy in their core model. Hence, they require changes to the target application or the hardware to produce accurate results. This paper introduces a mathematical workload model for a rasterization-based graphics Application Programming Interface (API) pipeline, named GAMORRA, which works based on the load of each stage of the pipeline. Firstly, GAMORRA models the load of each stage of the pipeline based on their input data size. Then, the calculated workloads of the stages are fed to a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model as explanatory variables. A hybrid offline/online training scheme is proposed as well to train the model. A suite of benchmarks is also designed to tune the model parameters based on the performance of the target system. The experiments were performed on Direct3D 11 and on two different rendering platforms comparing GAMORRA to an AutoRegressive (AR) model, a Frame Complexity Model (FCM) and a frequency-based (FRQ) model. The experiments show an average of 1.27 ms frame rendering time estimation error (9.4%) compared to an average of 1.87 ms error (13.2%) for FCM which is the best method among the three chosen methods. However, this comes at the cost of 0.54 ms (4.6%) increase in time complexity compared to FCM. Furthermore, GAMMORA improves frametime underestimations by 1.1% compared to FCM. © 2022","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Frequency estimation; Linear regression; Pipelines; Applications programming interfaces; Complexity modeling; Graphic application programming interface; Graphics applications; Performance; Pipeline architecture; Rendering time; Rendering time estimation; Time estimation; Workload model; Rasterization","Graphics API; Pipeline architecture; Rendering time estimation; Workload modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131464577"

In this paper, blockchain is designed to fit into the decentralized nature of the P2P market, securing the payment mechanism and transaction data store.

Laser-based scanning is a useful tool for applications ranging from reverse engineering or quality control at an object scale to large-scale environmental monitoring or topographic mapping. Beyond that, other specific applications require a large amount of LiDAR data during development, such as autonomous driving. Unfortunately, it is not easy to get a sufficient amount of ground-truth data due to time constraints and available resources. However, LiDAR simulation can generate classified data at a reduced cost. We propose a parameterized LiDAR to emulate a wide range of sensor models from airborne to terrestrial scanning. OpenGL's compute shaders are used to massively generate beams emitted by the virtual LiDAR sensors and solve their collision with the surrounding environment even with multiple returns. Our work is mainly intended for the rapid generation of datasets for neural networks, consisting of hundreds of millions of points.

The efficient dispatch of emergency vehicles (EMVs) requires realistic shortest-path algorithms involving the movement of EMVs within an urban network under emergency conditions. Trip-time estimates used in shortest-path algorithms would be much more precise if it were possible to model more realistically the interactions between EMVs and surrounding traffic, as well as the reactions of other vehicles in the presence of an EMV. Therefore, EMV trajectories should be studied at the microscopic level to accurately model the impact of EMV travel along a path shared with other vehicles. In this research, we develop three models to incorporate specific non-EMV reactions associated with changing lanes, mounting the sidewalk, and approaching an intersection, plus two algorithms to actuate traffic lights at signalized intersections. These models and algorithms were coded in commercial microscopic traffic simulation software through the implementation of an application programming interface (API) designed to overcome the limitations of the software to realistically simulate disturbed traffic conditions and anomalous nonemergency vehicle driver behaviour observed in the presence of an EMV. Basic information about these real-world effects was gleaned from video footage recorded in Santiago, Chile, by traffic cameras, fire truck-mounted cameras, and truck-originated GPS pulses. To validate the design, a real EMV trip captured by the footage was simulated by the API. The simulation considerably reduced the degree of error in delineating the path followed by the EMV compared to the default simulations generated by most commercially available software, thereby demonstrating that the API can provide highly accurate estimates of EMV trip times in an emergency context.  © 2023 Cristián E.

Herein, we investigate the performance of two neural operators, which have shown promising results so far, and we develop new practical extensions that will make them more accurate and robust and importantly more suitable for industrial-complexity applications. The first neural operator, DeepONet, was published in 2019 (Lu et al., 2019), and its original architecture was based on the universal approximation theorem of Chen & Chen (1995). The second one, named Fourier Neural Operator or FNO, was published in 2020 (Li et al., 2020), and it is based on parameterizing the integral kernel in the Fourier space. DeepONet is represented by a summation of products of neural networks (NNs), corresponding to the branch NN for the input function and the trunk NN for the output function; both NNs are general architectures, e.g., the branch NN can be replaced with a CNN or a ResNet. According to Kovachki et al. (2021), FNO in its continuous form can be viewed conceptually as a DeepONet with a specific architecture of the branch NN and a trunk NN represented by a trigonometric basis. In order to compare FNO with DeepONet computationally for realistic setups, we develop several extensions of FNO that can deal with complex geometric domains as well as mappings where the input and output function spaces are of different dimensions. We also develop an extended DeepONet with special features that provide inductive bias and accelerate training, and we present a faster implementation of DeepONet with cost comparable to the computational cost of FNO, which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform. We consider 16 different benchmarks to demonstrate the relative performance of the two neural operators, including instability wave analysis in hypersonic boundary layers, prediction of the vorticity field of a flapping airfoil, porous media simulations in complex-geometry domains, etc. We follow the guiding principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) for scientific data management and stewardship. The performance of DeepONet and FNO is comparable for relatively simple settings, but for complex geometries the performance of FNO deteriorates greatly. We also compare theoretically the two neural operators and obtain similar error estimates for DeepONet and FNO under the same regularity assumptions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Complex networks; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Functions; Geometry; Mapping; Network architecture; Porous materials; Deep learning; Deeponet; FNO; Function spaces; Input functions; Neural-networks; Nonlinear mappings; Operator regression; Performance; Scientific machine learning; Reusability","Deep learning; DeepONet; FNO; Nonlinear mappings; Operator regression; Scientific machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126008298"

For this reason, a map named “Driving Route Planning” Application Programming Interface server is built on the cloud, receiving online traffic route information, and the Hidden Markov Model is applied for prediction optimization of future operating conditions. The remaining driving range of Battery Electric Vehicles is finally estimated according to the future energy consumption and the remaining dischargeable energy. The results show that the prediction of operating condition combined with traffic route information and Hidden Markov Model reflects the switching of future operating conditions more accurately and quickly. The relative error of the remaining driving range estimation proposed keeps within 5% under the real operating verification. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Plug-in electric vehicles; Range finders; Secondary batteries; Driving range; Energy-consumption; Future energies; Future energy consumption; Future operating condition; On-line traffic; Online traffic route information; Operating condition; Remaining driving range; Route information; Traffic routes; complexity; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; estimation method; optimization; road traffic; strategic approach; Energy utilization","Future energy consumption; Future operating condition; Online traffic route information; Remaining driving range","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125938735"

However, IoT application systems have often been designed and deployed independently without considering the standards of devices, logics, and data communications. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the IoT server platform called Smart Environmental Monitoring and Analytical in Real-Time (SEMAR) for integrating IoT application systems using standards. SEMAR offers Big Data environments with built-in functions for data aggregations, synchronizations, and classifications with machine learning. Moreover, plug-in functions can be easily implemented. Data from devices for different sensors can be accepted directly and through network connections, which will be used in real-time for user interfaces, text files, and access to other systems through Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) services. For evaluations of SEMAR, we implemented the platform and integrated five IoT application systems, namely, the air-conditioning guidance system, the fingerprint-based indoor localization system, the water quality monitoring system, the environment monitoring system, and the air quality monitoring system. When compared with existing research on IoT platforms, the proposed SEMAR IoT application server platform offers higher flexibility and interoperability with the functions for IoT device managements, data communications, decision making, synchronizations, and filters that can be easily integrated with external programs or IoT applications without changing the codes. The results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal. © 2022 by the authors.","Air conditioning; Air quality; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Convolutional codes; Decision making; Interface states; Monitoring; Real time systems; User interfaces; Water quality; Application systems; Applications programming interfaces; Environmental Monitoring; Internet of thing application system; MQTT; Real- time; Representational state transfer; Representational state transfer application programming interface; Server platform; Smart environmental monitoring and analytical in real-time; Internet of things","Internet of Things; IoT application system; MQTT; REST API; SEMAR; sensor; server platform","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137548363"

Meanwhile, the system services rely on their service helpers to enforce security checks for protection. Unfortunately, the security checks in the service helpers may be bypassed via directly exploiting the non-SDK (hidden) APIs. In this paper, we systematically study the vulnerabilities due to the hidden API exploitation and analyze the effectiveness of Googles countermeasures. We aim to answer if there are still vulnerable hidden APIs that can be exploited in newest Android 12. We develop a static analysis tool called ServiceAudit to automatically mine the inconsistent security enforcement between service helper classes and the hidden service APIs. We apply ServiceAudit to Android 612. Our tool discovers 112 vulnerabilities in Android 6 with a higher precision than existing approaches. Moreover, in Android 11 and 12, we identify more than 25 hidden APIs with inconsistent protections; however, only one of the vulnerable APIs can lead to severe security problem in Android 11, and none of them work on Android 12.

The performance of these approximations can be improved by parallel implementations exploiting parallel architectures, such as OpenMP and CUDA. In this paper, we introduce the parallel implementation to two astrodynamic applications. The first is the gravitational finite element model (FEM): a piecewise Chebyshev approximation that replaces high degree and order gravitational spherical harmonic models (SHMs). Thus, much lower degree, locally valid functions can efficiently model and compute local gravity perturbations in parallel structure for efficient performance. For this model, the total gravity acceleration is split into a reference and disturbance term. The reference includes two-body plus J2, which are relatively cheap to compute. The FEM approximates the higher-order gravity terms. It is developed from a 2D mesh grid covering a sphere of a specified radius, and a family of spherical shells is sampled using a cosine distribution in the radial direction. To reduce the required memory when seeking a specific accuracy, an adaptive version of the gravitational FEM is introduced. In addition, a parallel implementation of the FEM using OpenMP is preseneted. We show the runtime comparison for the 200 degree × 200 order EGM2008 SHM and the serial and parallel equivalent FEM algorithms. The other application is the Chebyshev-Picard method (CPM): a numerical integrator that solves an ordinary differential equation by approximating the integrand using a Chebyshev approximant and iterates over the trajectory via Picard iteration. A parallel CUDA implementation of the CPM method in conjunction with the EGM2008 SHM and the FEM is introduced. We present numerical examples for propagating four Earth-orbiting satellites considering both the 200 × 200 EGM2008 SHM and the equivalent FEM representation to test the algorithm’s performance via parallel and serial computation (i.e., a single CPU thread). © 2022, The Author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Harmonic analysis; Iterative methods; Orbits; Ordinary differential equations; Parallel architectures; Polynomials; Spacecraft; Spheres; Chebyshev; Chebyshev polynomials; Finite element modelling (FEM); Functions approximations; Numerical integrations; Parallel Computation; Parallel implementations; Performance; Picard method; Spherical harmonic models; Numerical methods","Chebyshev polynomials; Function approximation; Numerical integration; Parallel computation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128903197"

Blockchain storage has also become a research hotspot in industry, finance, and academia due to its security, and its unique data storage management model is gradually becoming a key technology to play its value in various fields’ applications. However, with the increasing amount of data written into the blockchain, the blockchain system faces many problems in its actual implementation of the application, such as high storage space occupation, low data flexibility and availability, low retrieval efficiency, poor scalability, etc. To improve the above problems, this paper combines off-chain storage technology and deduplication technology to optimize the blockchain storage model. Firstly, this paper adopts the double-chain model to reduce the data storage of the major chain system, which stores a small amount of primary data and supervises the vice chain through an Application Programming Interface (API). The vice chain stores a large number of copies of data as well as non-transactional data. Our model divides the vice chain storage system into two layers, including a storage layer and a processing layer. In the processing layer, deduplication technology is applied to reduce the redundancy of vice chain data. Our double-chain storage model with high scalability enhances data flexibility, is more suitable as a distributed storage system, and performs well in data retrieval. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Attention is focused on outlining the workflow and data transfer penalties associated with ""plugging in"" a recently developed GPU-based chemistry library into (a) a purely CPU-based solver and (b) a GPU-based solver, where, except for the chemistry, all other variables are computed on the GPU. This comparison allows quantification of host-to-device (and vice versa) data transfer penalties on the overall solver speedup as a function of mesh and reaction mechanism size. To this end, a recently developed GPU-based chemistry library known as UMChemGPU is employed to treat the kinetics in the flow solver KARFS. UMChemGPU replaces conventional CPU-based Cantera routines using a matrix-based formulation. The impact of i) data transfer times, ii) chemistry acceleration, and iii) the hardware architecture is studied in detail in the context of GPU saturation limits. Hydrogen and dimethyl ether (DME) reaction mechanisms are used to assess the impact of the number of species/reactions on overall/chemistry-only speedup. It was found that offloading the source term computation to UMChemGPU results in up to 7X reduction in overall time to solution and four orders of magnitude faster source term computation compared to conventional CPU-based methods. Furthermore, the metrics for achieving maximum performance gain using GPU chemistry with an MPI + CUDA solver are explained using the Roofline model. Integrating the UMChemGPU with an MPI + OpenMP solver does not improve the overall performance due to the associated data copy time between the device (GPU) and host (CPU) memory spaces. The performance portability was demonstrated using three different GPU architectures, and the findings are expected to translate to a wide variety of high-performance codes in the combustion community. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, most studies of 3-D RT models have been restricted to limited applications due to the low computational efficiency. Therefore, this study proposed a graphic processing unit (GPU)-based solution for the ray tracing 3-D RT model. A state-of-the-art graphics and compute application programming interface (API), Vulkan, were introduced to implement the RT process. A bounding box method was adopted for the computation acceleration. By comparison with a central processing unit (CPU)-based solution, the performance efficiency of the proposed solution is significantly better: the simulation time of a GPU model is significantly reduced by more than 99% when facing a large-scale simulation mission. The simulation accuracy of the two solutions is similar, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.005, 0.032, and 0.31 K for the red, near-infrared (NIR), and brightness temperature (BT) images, respectively. An evaluation based on airborne multiangle measurements also indicated that the accuracy of the proposed solution was satisfactory for simulating the red and NIR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and BT directional anisotropies (DAs), with RMSEs lower than 0.003, 0.020, and 0.20 K, respectively, when treating the whole scene as a pixel.

In the framework, balance of momentum is solved in a global iterative loop and single crystal plasticity is solved in an inner loop. For the latter, a fully implicit time integration scheme is used in which the correct solution is found using a residual established based on plastic velocity gradient. The elastic-viscoplastic response of single crystals is modeled by coupling slip system based constitutive equations to crystal kinematics. The single crystal response is validated using experimentally observed behavior of fcc and hcp single crystals for uniaxial and cyclic deformation, respectively. The single crystal plasticity module provides solution to the global FFT solver. An FFT scheme based on deformation gradient is derived to address the full-field micromechanical response for finite deformation. Adaptive time increment is used for ensuring convergence. OpenMP based multi-threading is employed for ensuring faster simulations. The current FFT model is validated for an fcc polycrystal by comparing the results against those from an open-source crystal plasticity code, and shows an excellent agreement. In the second study, the FFT solver is used for analyzing the deformation behavior of an α-β Ti polycrystal. In this dual phase polycrystal, plastic deformations of α and β phases are modeled using a dislocation density based and a power law based constitutive framework, respectively. The model is able to capture the expected salient features of deformation of both phases.

Current industrial practices usually use test functions to implement the test steps of a test case and then to compose the executable test case by choosing the test functions to call manually. It is time-consuming and could lead to invalid test results by selecting inappropriate test functions. In this article, we propose an automatic test function recommendation approach named Scenario-based Recommendation of TEst Function (SRTEF). Given a test step of a test case, SRTEF uses the weighted description similarity and the scenario similarity to recommend test functions. The description similarity utilizes the deep structured semantic model (DSSM) to measure the relatedness between a test step and a test function by their literal descriptions. The test scenario and the test function usage scenario are considered to calculate the scenario similarity. SRTEF has been successfully applied in Huawei. The systematic experiments have been conducted to evaluate SRTEF by using the dataset from Huawei and comparing with BiInformation source-based KnowledgE Recommendation (BIKER), reported as the best approach so far. The results show that SRTEF outperforms BIKER with significant positive ratios consistently in all the three selection strategies, i.e., Top-3, Top-5, and Top-10. The DSSM shows its advantage over word embedding by the double performance of capturing the semantic relatedness in SRTEF.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Job analysis; Libraries; Application programming interface  recommendation; Applications programming interfaces; Deep structured semantic model; Documentation; Java; Semantic modelling; Task analysis; Test function recommendation; Test function usage scenario; Test scenario; Test-functions; Usage scenarios; Semantics","Application programming interface (API) recommendation; deep structured semantic model (DSSM); test function recommendation; test function usage scenario; test scenario","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129617636"

There are several problems with the current operation maintenance applications in underground utilities, including the lack of a digitalized 3D model with a comprehensive database for dynamically editing data on the site. This research proposes a pipeline operation and maintenance management system (POMMS) by employing building information modeling (BIM), geographic information system (GIS), and augmented reality (AR) and integrating various project information sources through application programming interface (API) and cloud database. This system can facilitate decision-making by more realistic 3D visualizations, enhanced integration of construction, geographic and inspection information, and efficient data retrieval. The proposed system is applied to an actual project to validate its efficiency. In this research, two scenarios and one survey were conducted to investigate the performance of POMMS.

This article presents a novel variant of the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm called declining neighborhood simulated annealing (DNSA) specifically developed for the problem of fixture synthesis. The objective is to minimize measurement errors in the machined features induced by the misalignment at locators-workpiece contact points. The algorithm systematically evaluates different fixture layouts to reach a sufficient approximation of the most robust layout. For each iteration, a set of previously accepted candidates are exploited to direct the search toward the optimal region. Throughout the progress of the algorithm, the search space is reduced and the new candidates are designated according to a declining probability density function (PDF). To assure best performance, the DNSA parameters are configured using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPOSIS). Moreover, the parameters are set to auto-adapt the complexity of a given input based on a Shanon entropy index. The optimization process is carried out automatically in the computer-aided design (CAD) environment NX; a computer code was developed for this purpose using the application programming interface (API) NXOpen.

By this means, data enriched with semantics by means of knowledge graphs become available for automatic analysis.

This allows for the rapid promotion of this technology. OpenVX is a computer vision framework with vital considerations for performance and portability. This paper proposes a new framework that effectively accelerates OpenVX with Halide and MLIR. Our framework possesses Halide’s properties of decoupling algorithms and also has schedules such as an auto-scheduler. It also has MLIR’s multi-level dialects that structure the operations and the data accesses. To generate more efficient programs, we propose a bridge that can transform the programs written in OpenVX into Halide and then translate from Halide to MLIR.

Especially hybrid machines combining additive and subtractive technologies (AM/SM), have become a potential solution for manufacturing and repairing operations in terms of material waste reduction, time consumption and flexibility. Nevertheless, this technology has implications for the machine and the auxiliary elements as well as other challenges: digitalization, process parameterization or CAD/CAM solutions. Thereby, this work proposes a new methodology for hybrid manufacturing systems, a programmed interface to interact between additive and subtractive technologies within the same environment. The developed application-programming interface (API) offers a CAM module oriented to AM with appropriate laser metal deposition (LMD) parameters, with three different options of strategy programming: Planar LMD, 3-axis LMD and 5-axis LMD. Additionally, the value of this work stems from the implementation of an algorithm to estimate the cladding geometry, so, the full resulting geometry can be considered as the new blank for SM. A height measuring laser sensor was implemented in the LMD machine to obtain the real height of the generated clad, critical for the next machining step. Finally, to validate the methodology, a blisk made of Hastelloy®X was built-up on Inconel®718 with LMD and milled to the final size.

Computational models are becoming increasingly popular as a systematic tool to analyze the functioning of complex biochemical networks, such as those involved in cell signaling. CellNOpt is a framework to build predictive logic-based models of signaling pathways by training a prior knowledge network to biochemical data obtained from perturbation experiments. This training can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved using metaheuristics. However, the genetic algorithm used so far in CellNOpt presents limitations in terms of execution time and quality of solutions when applied to large instances. Thus, in order to overcome those issues, in this paper we propose the use of a method based on ant colony optimization, adapted to the problem at hand and parallelized using a hybrid approach.

This study proposes noise-robust OCSR APIs based on an end-to-end lip-reading architecture for practical applications in various environments. Several OCSR APIs, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Naver, were evaluated using the Google Voice Command Dataset v2 to obtain the optimum performance. Based on performance, the Microsoft API was integrated with Google’s trained word2vec model to enhance the keywords with more complete semantic information. The extracted word vector was integrated with the proposed lip-reading architecture for audio-visual speech recognition. Three forms of convolutional neural networks (3D CNN, 3D dense connection CNN, and multilayer 3D CNN) were used in the proposed lip-reading architecture. Vectors extracted from API and vision were classified after concatenation. The proposed architecture enhanced the OCSR API average accuracy rate by 14.42% using standard ASR evaluation measures along with the signal-to-noise ratio.

This work developed an automatic light adjustment system at Thammasat University, Rangsit Campus, Thailand, with a primary objective of optimizing energy efficiency, while providing sufficient illumination for the campus. The development consists of two sections: the device control and the prediction model. The device control functionalities were developed with the user interface to enable control of the smart street light devices and the application programming interface (API) to send the light-adjusting command. The prediction model was created using an AI-assisted data analytic platform to obtain the predicted illuminance values so as to, subsequently, suggest light-dimming values according to the current environment. Four machine-learning models were performed on a nine-month environmental dataset to acquire predictions. The result demonstrated that the three-day window size setting with the XGBoost model yielded the best performance, attaining the correlation coefficient value of 0.922, showing a linear relationship between actual and predicted illuminance values using the test dataset. The prediction retrieval API was established and connected to the device control API, which later created an automated system that operated at a 20-min interval. This allowed real-time feedback to automatically adjust the smart street lighting devices through the purpose-designed data analytics features. © 2023 by the authors.","Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Smart city; Statistical tests; Street lighting; Applications programming interfaces; Automated systems; Data analytics; Device control; Environmental sensor; Internet of thing; Prediction modelling; Smart street lighting; WEB application; Web applications; Data Analytics","artificial intelligence; automated system; data analytics; environmental sensors; Internet of Things (IoT); smart city; smart street lighting; web application","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148970912"

In the design of 3D-TSV, several perceptual problems have been solved. We present a novel algorithm for generating a space-filling and evenly spaced set of stress lines. The algorithm obtains a more regular appearance by considering the locations of lines, and enables the extraction of a level-of-detail representation with adjustable sparseness of the trajectories along a certain stress direction. A new combined visualization of two principal directions via oriented ribbons enables to convey ambiguities in the orientation of the principal stress directions. Additional depth cues have been added to improve the perception of the spatial relationships between trajectories. 3D-TSV provides a modular and generic implementation of key algorithms required for a trajectory-based visual analysis of principal stress directions, including the automatic seeding of space-filling stress lines, their extraction using numerical schemes, their mapping to an effective renderable representation, and rendering options to convey structures with special mechanical properties. 3D-TSV is accessible to end users via a C++- and OpenGL-based rendering frontend that is seamlessly connected to a MatLab-based extraction backend.

However, the development of parallel software for heterogeneous computing systems is a rather difficult task due to the requirements of high performance, easy programmability, and scalability. The paper investigates the efficiency of parallel-pipeline processing of video information in multicore heterogeneous systems on a chip (SoC). A mathematical model of the used structures is described and the criteria for efficiently processing video data are formulated, based on which the target function is built. The typical scheme for parallel-pipeline processing of video data using various streaming video processing accelerators (DSP, GPU, ISP, VDP, VPU, etc.) is presented. A scheme for parallel-pipeline processing of video data on a heterogeneous 1892VM248 SoC is developed. A technique for efficient parallel-pipeline video information processing in heterogeneous computing SoCs, including a software stack consisting of an operating system level, a programming technology level, and an application level, is proposed. A comparative analysis of the most common programming technologies for heterogeneous SoCs, such as OpenCL, OpenMP, MPI, and OpenAMP, is carried out. The results of the analysis show that, depending on the purpose of the end device, two programming paradigms should be used: based on OpenCL technology (for embedded systems) and MPI technology (for intercore and interprocessor interactions). The results of parallel-pipeline processing in the face recognition problem confirms the effectiveness of the chosen solutions. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Data handling; Embedded systems; Face recognition; Multicore programming; Parallel processing systems; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Programmable logic controllers; Video signal processing; 1892vm248 processor; Heterogeneous computing system; Pipeline processing; Problem-oriented core; Programming tools; System on a chip; Systems-on-a-chip; Video data; Video information; Video information processing; System-on-chip","1892VM248 processor; heterogeneous computing systems; problem-oriented cores; programming tools; systems on a chip; video information processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145778486"

This involves the decision of generation, transmission, and distribution of resources at different time horizons. They also face challenges in incorporating new forms of generation, distributed generations, which are located close to consumer centers, and new loads such as electric vehicles. Traditionally, the nonlinear Newton–Raphson optimization method is used to support operational decisions in such systems, known as Optimal Power Flow (OPF). Although OPF is one of the most practically important and well-researched sub-fields of constrained nonlinear optimization and has a rich history of research, it faces the convergence difficulties associated with all problems represented using non-linear power flow constraints. The proposal is to present an approach in a software component in cloud Application Programming Interface (API) format, with alternative modeling of the electrical optimization problem as a non-linear objective function and representing electric network constraints modeled through both current and voltage Kirchhoff linear equations. This representation overcomes the non-linearity of the OPF problem considering Distributed Energy Resources (DER).

To recoup their training costs, a model provider can monetize DL models through Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). Generally, the model is deployed at the cloud, while providing a publicly accessible Application Programming Interface (API) for paid queries to obtain benefits. However, model stealing attacks have posed security threats to this model monetizing scheme as they steal the model without paying for future extensive queries. Specifically, an adversary queries a targeted model to obtain input-output pairs and thus infer the model&#x2019;s internal working mechanism by reverse-engineering a substitute model, which has deprived model owner&#x2019;s business advantage and leaked the privacy of the model. In this work, we observe that the confidence vector or the top-1 confidence returned from the model under attack (MUA) varies in a relative large degree given different queried inputs. Therefore, rich internal information of the MUA is leaked to the attacker that facilities her reconstruction of a substitute model. We thus propose to leverage adversarial confidence perturbation to hide such varied confidence distribution given different queries, consequentially against model stealing attacks (dubbed as APMSA). In other words, the confidence vectors returned now is similar for queries from a specific category, considerably reducing information leakage of the MUA. To achieve this objective, through automated optimization, we constructively add delicate noise into per input query to make its confidence close to the decision boundary of the MUA. Generally, this process is achieved in a similar means of crafting adversarial examples but with a distinction that the hard label is preserved to be the same as the queried input. This retains the inference utility (i.e., without sacrificing the inference accuracy) for normal users but bounded the leaked confidence information to the attacker in a small constrained area (i.e., close to decision boundary). The later renders greatly deteriorated accuracy of the attacker&#x2019;s substitute model. As the APMSA serves as a plug-in front-end and requires no change to the MUA, it is thus generic and easy to deploy. The high efficacy of APMSA is validated through experiments on datasets of CIFAR10 and GTSRB. Given a MUA model of ResNet-18 on the CIFAR10, our defense can degrade the accuracy of the stolen model by up to 15% (rendering the stolen model useless to a large extent) with <italic>0% accuracy drop for normal user&#x2019;s hard-label inference request</italic>.

Although these data are of vital importance in the development of data intelligence applications, such as business applications that exploit traffic data to predict traffic demand, they are prone to data quality errors produced by, e.g., failures of sensors and network faults. This paper explores the quality of Dynamic Open Government Data. To that end, a single case is studied using traffic data from the official Greek OGD portal. The portal uses an Application Programming Interface (API), which is essential for effective dynamic data dissemination. Our research approach includes assessing data quality using statistical and machine learning methods to detect missing values and anomalies. Traffic flow-speed correlation analysis, seasonal-trend decomposition, and unsupervised isolation Forest (iForest) are used to detect anomalies. iForest anomalies are classified as sensor faults and unusual traffic conditions. The iForest algorithm is also trained on additional features, and the model is explained using explainable artificial intelligence. There are 20.16% missing traffic observations, and 50% of the sensors have 15.5% to 33.43% missing values. The average percent of anomalies per sensor is 71.1%, with only a few sensors having less than 10% anomalies. Seasonal-trend decomposition detected 12.6% anomalies in the data of these sensors, and iForest 11.6%, with very few overlaps.

The paper argues that risk-oriented approaches provide an interesting solution to account for the long-term resilience of buildings, both for the design of new structures and the rehabilitation of existing ones. The proposed research draws upon the standard definition of risk as a function of vulnerability, hazard and exposure to develop an optimization-based methodology for risk appraisal of buildings in seismic conditions. The proposed methodology allows to identify the optimum layout and thickness of shear walls in a reinforced concrete frame, based on a target risk performance. This is achieved through the coupling of an evolutionary computing environment with an object-oriented structural analysis tool, involving its native Application Programming Interface (API). The latter allows to automate the search for the optimum shear wall configuration solution. The research is validated on the Beichuan Hotel building in Old Beichuan (China), heavily affected by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake.

Starting from 2016, and after the release of Nougat version (Version 7) by Google, developers have had access to the GNSS raw measurements through the new application programming interface (API), namely android.location (API level 24). However, the new API does not provide the typical GNSS observations directly (e.g., pseudorange, carrier-phase and Doppler observations) which have to be generated by the users themselves. Although several Apps have been developed for the GNSS observations generation, various data analyses indicate quality concerns, from biases to observation inconsistency in the generated GNSS observations output from those Apps. The quality concerns would subsequently affect GNSS data processing such as cycle slip detection, code smoothing and ultimately positioning performance. In this study, we first investigate algorithms for GNSS observations generation from the android.location API output. We then evaluate the performances of two widely used Apps (Geo++RINEX logger and GnssLogger Apps), as well as our newly developed one (namely UofC CSV2RINEX tool) which converts the CSV file to a Receiver INdependent Exchange (RINEX) file.

IoMT is reforming the medical industry by adopting information and communication technologies (ICTs). Identity verification, secure collection, and exchange of medical data are essential in health applications. In this study, we implemented a hybrid security solution to secure the collection and management of personal health data using Spring Framework (SF), Services for Sensitive Data (TSD) as a service platform, and Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol (HTTP (H)) security methods. The adopted solution (SFTSDH = SF + TSD + H) instigated the following security features: identity brokering, OAuth2, multifactor authentication, and access control to protect the Microservices Architecture Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Moreover, we extended the adopted security solution to develop a digital infrastructure to facilitate the research and innovation work in the electronic health (eHealth) section, focusing on solution validation with theoretical evaluation and experimental testing. We used a web engineering security methodology to achieve and explain the adopted security solution. As a case study, we designed and implemented electronic coaching (eCoaching) prototype system and deployed the same in the developed infrastructure to securely record and share personal health data. Furthermore, we compared the test results with related studies qualitatively for the efficient evaluation of the implemented security solution. The SFTSDH implementation and configuration in the prototype system have effectively secured the eCoach APIs from an attack in all the considered scenarios. The eCoach prototype with the SFTSDH solution effectively sustained a load of (≈) 1000 concurrent users in the developed digital health infrastructure. In addition, we performed a qualitative comparison among the following security solutions: SF security, third-party security, and SFTSDH, where SFTSDH showed a promising outcome. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Authentication; Health care; Hypertext systems; Medical information systems; Network architecture; Network security; Application programming interface security; Applications programming interfaces; Ecoach; Electronic healthcare; Medical services; Oauth2; Privacy; Prototype; Security; Spring framework; TSD; HTTP","API Security; eCoach; HTTP; OAuth2; spring framework; TSD","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128267164"

Many scientists believe that the pandemic originated from Wuhan, China, before spreading to other parts of the globe. To reduce the spread of the disease, decision makers encouraged measures such as hand washing, face masking, and social distancing. In early 2021, some countries including the United States began administering COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination brought a relief to the public; it also generated a lot of debates from anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine groups. The controversy and debate surrounding COVID-19 vaccine influenced the decision of several people in either to accept or reject vaccination. Because of data limitations, social media data, collected through live streaming public tweets using an Application Programming Interface (API) search, is considered a viable and reliable resource to study the opinion of the public on Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Thus, this study examines 3 sentiment computation methods (Azure Machine Learning, VADER, and TextBlob) to analyze COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Five learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, LinearSVC, and Naïve Bayes) with different combination of three vectorization methods (Doc2Vec, CountVectorizer, and TF-IDF) were deployed. Vocabulary normalization was threefold; potter stemming, lemmatization, and potter stemming with lemmatization. For each vocabulary normalization strategy, we designed, developed, and evaluated 42 models. The study shows that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy slowly decreases over time; suggesting that the public gradually feels warm and optimistic about COVID-19 vaccination. Moreover, combining potter stemming and lemmatization increased model performances. Finally, the result of our experiment shows that TextBlob + TF-IDF + LinearSVC has the best performance in classifying public sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative with an accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 0.96752, 0.96921, 0.92807 and 0.94702 respectively. It means that the best performance was achieved when using TextBlob sentiment score, with TF-IDF vectorization and LinearSVC classification model. We also found out that combining two vectorizations (CountVectorizer and TF-IDF) decreases model accuracy. © 2022 The Authors","Application programming interfaces (API); COVID-19; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Vaccines; Coronaviruses; Covid-19; Lemmatization; Machine-learning; Performance; Sentiment analysis; Text-mining; Twitter; Vaccine hesitancy; Vectorization; Sentiment analysis","Covid-19; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; Vaccine Hesitancy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139254823"

People all over the world take the social media to express their opinions and general emotions regarding this phenomenon. In a relatively short period of time, tweets about the new Corona virus increased by an amount never before seen on the social networking site Twitter. In this research work, Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data to Identify the Feelings of Indians during Corona Pandemic under National Lockdown using recurrent neural network is proposed. The proposed method is analyzed using four steps: that is Data collection, data preparation, Building sentiment analysis model and Visualization of the results. For Data collection, the twitter dataset are collected from social networking platform twitter by application programming interface. For Data preparation, the input data set are pre-processed for removing URL links, removing unnecessary spaces, removing punctuations and numbers. After data cleaning or preprocessing entire particular characters and non-US characters from Standard Code for Information Interchange, apart from hash tag, are extracted as refined tweet text. In addition, entire behaviors less than three alphabets are not assumed at analysis of tweets, lastly, tokenization and derivation was carried out by Porter Stemmer to perform opinion mining. To authenticate the method, categorized the tweets linked to COVID-19 national lockdown. For categorization, recurrent neural method is used. RNN classify the sentiment classification as positive, negative and neutral sentiment scores. The efficiency of the proposed RNN based Sentimental analysis classification of COVID-19 is assessed various performances by evaluation metrics, like sensitivity, precision, recall, f-measure, specificity and accuracy.

Standardized data models were proposed to overcome the interoperability gap between these deployments. Next generation service interfaces-linked data (NGSI-LD) is one of the proposed platforms that exploits linked data and proposes an information model and an application programming interface (API) for easy use and standard management of context information. The NGSI-LD information model is based on JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD) as a serialization format for context information. This efficiently exploits the potential of semantics and linked open data. However, the NGSI-LD graph API and query language are still theoretically defined and limited to some preliminary works. Consequently, current NGSI-LD implementations are mainly based on traditional databases, where the JSON-LD serialization is supported but not exploited owing to the difficulties in defining and implementing new NGSI-LD based Graph APIs. One of the basic solutions is the use of an RDF store for NGSI-LD payloads because these types of databases are well defined and maintained and will not need any added effort for JSON-LD based payloads. However, the main complication at this level is the use of reification to annotate relationships. This study focused on both aspects of exploiting the semantics of NGSI-LD by proposing standardized mapping mechanisms to RDF graphs without reifying JSON-LD payloads and with respect to the NGSI-LD context model and API. Our main proposals highlight that exploiting the RDF store for processing NGSI-LD data semantically is feasible and uncomplicated. We illustrated the proposed mapping approaches with real use-case examples and a possible exploitation of semantic approaches. © 2022 by the authors.

Great programming effort is needed to manually implement efficient out-of-core stencil code. To relieve such programming burdens, directive-based frameworks emerged, such as the pipelined accelerator (PACC); however, they usually lack specific optimizations to reduce data transfer. In this paper, we extend PACC with two data-centric optimizations to address data transfer problems. The first is a direct-mapping scheme that eliminates host (i.e., CPU) buffers, which intermediate between the original data and device buffers. The second is a region-sharing scheme that significantly reduces host-to-device data transfer. The extended PACC was applied to an acoustic wave propagator, automatically extending the length of original serial code 2.3-fold to obtain the out-of-core code. Experimental results revealed that on a Tesla V100 GPU, the generated code ran 41.0, 22.1, and 3.6 times as fast as implementations based on Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), Unified Memory, and the previous PACC, respectively. The generated code also demonstrated usefulness with small datasets that fit in the device capacity, running 1.3 times as fast as an in-core implementation.

Checkpointing-aided parallel execution (CAPE) is an approach that utilizes the discontinuous incremental checkpointing technique (DICKPT) to translate and execute OpenMP programs on distributed-memory architectures automatically. Currently, CAPE implements the OpenMP execution model by utilizing the DICKPT to distribute parallel jobs and their data to slave machines, and then collects the results after executing these distributed jobs. Although this model has been proven to be effective in terms of performance and compatibility with OpenMP on distributed-memory systems, it cannot fully exploit the capabilities of multicore processors. This paper presents a novel execution model for CAPE that utilizes two levels of parallelism. In the proposed model, we add another level of parallelism in the form of multithreaded processes on slave machines with the goal of better exploiting their multicore CPUs.

Here, the inter-frame compression is done by a proposed progression-based frame prediction technique and a newly introduced frame-similarity measurement parameter. The inter-frame co-relation is removed by using progression method followed by identifying similarity of the frames selected by the progression method. On the other hand, the intra-frame compression is done by adopting an existing compression technique with suitable modification to make it more energy saving over its existing counterpart. Once the compressed video is transmitted over the IoT network, at the server side it is reconstructed where we use the service of a popular online face recognition API, KAIROS considering an application of disaster victim recognition. The comparative performance of the scheme is evaluated both theoretically and through ONE simulator-based simulation. Precisely, we claim that our scheme saves on average 71.46% energy over its competitors with least memory usage and acceptable reconstruction quality. Finally, the entire scheme is evaluated through testbed implementation and shown that it can recognize faces successfully from the videos transmitted over DTN-based IoT with accuracy more than 0.96 while keeping compression ratio at more than 31. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Delay tolerant networks; Disasters; Energy conservation; Image compression; Internet of things; Smartphones; Comparative performance; Compressed video; Compression scheme; Compression techniques; Memory usage; Prediction techniques; Reconstruction quality; Similarity measurements; Face recognition","Delay-tolerant network; Face recognition; Internet of things; ONE simulator; Video compression","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102173601"

The steady-state continuous MSMPR crystallization of melitracen via cooling has been recently demonstrated in the literature, with crystallization kinetic parameters regressed from experimental data. Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) has been implemented extensively for the optimization of separation process designs in various manufacturing sectors, but not for systematic design and screening of MSMPR cascade flowsheet configurations. This study performs MINLP optimization to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of a MSMPR cascade for continuous melitracen crystallization with solid recycling. Process flowsheets consider varying numbers of crystallizers and recycle stream feed point location. First, the MSMPR model describing API solubility, crystallization kinetics, population balance equations, and process mass balances is described. The MINLP problem and constraints are then described with detailed costing equations. The optimal flowsheet configuration for both considered plant capacities (103 and 104 kg API yr-1) is three crystallizers with recycling fed to the first and last vessels. This study illustrates rapid screening of continuous crystallization cascades via MINLP optimization, toward fully Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (CPM) plant designs. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Several studies have been done to solve this problem with high applicability, but a certain percentage of the output consisted of cracked fruits, thus reducing the quality of the system. The manual sorting results in high costs and low quality, so it is necessary that automatic grading is performed after destemming. This research focused on developing a method to identify and classify cracked chilli fruits caused by the destemming process. The convolution neural network (CNN) model was built and trained to identify cracks; then, appropriate control signals were sent to the actuator for classification. Image processing operations are supported by the OpenCV library, while the TensorFlow data structure is used as a database and the Keras application programming interface supports the construction and training of neural network models. Experiments were carried out in both the static and working conditions, which, respectively, achieved an accurate identification rate of 97 and 95.3%. In addition, a success rate of 93% was found even when the chilli body is wrinkled due to drying after storage time at 120 hours.

Existing side-channel attacks on GPUs typically leak information from graphics libraries like OpenGL and CUDA, which require creating contentions within the GPU resource space and are being mitigated with software patches. This article evaluates potential side channels exposed at a lower-level interface between GPUs and CPUs, namely the graphics interrupts. These signals could indicate unique signatures of GPU workload, allowing a spy process to infer the behavior of other processes. We demonstrate the practicality and generality of such side-channel exploitation with a variety of assumed attack scenarios. Simulations on both Nvidia and Intel graphics adapters showed that our attack could achieve high accuracy, while in-depth studies were also presented to explore the low-level rationale behind such effectiveness. On top of that, we further propose a practical mitigation scheme which protects GPU workloads against the graphics-interrupt-based side-channel attack by piggybacking mask payloads on them to generate interfering graphics interrupt 'noises'. Experiments show that our mitigation technique effectively prohibited spy processes from inferring user behaviors via analyzing runtime patterns of graphics interrupt with only trivial overhead.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Behavioral research; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Attack scenarios; Devices and systems; In-depth study; Mitigation schemes; Mitigation techniques; Resource space; Software patches; User behaviors; Side channel attack","GPU; graphics interrupts; machine learning; Side-channel attacks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112465792"

To cope with such a problem, Processing-In-Memory (PIM) techniques can be applied as an alternative solution. Especially, the recommendation system, which is one of the major machine learning applications used in data centers, requires a large memory capacity and therefore represents a suitable candidate application that could be helped by the PIM technique. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning framework, PIMCaffe, designed for in-memory neural processing units and its evaluation environment. PIMCaffe consists of two components: A Caffe2-based deep learning framework that supports PIM acceleration and a PIM-emulating hardware platform. We develop a suite of functions, libraries, application programming interfaces, and a device driver to support the framework. In addition, we implement a prototype Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in PIMCaffe to evaluate the performance of our platform with machine learning applications. Our prototype NPU design includes a vector processor for parallel vector processing and a systolic array unit for matrix multiplication. Using the proposed software framework, we perform a detailed analysis of the in-memory neural processing unit. PIMCaffe supports evaluations of recommendation systems and various convolutional neural network models on the in-memory neural processing unit.

While a deterministic application-aware TE is required for these mission-critical applications, a negotiation procedure between applications and network operators needs to undergo major simplification to fulfill the scalability of the application based on emerging microservices and container-based architecture. In this paper, we propose a NetworkAPI framework which allows an application to indicate a desired TE behavior inside IP packets by leveraging Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6). In the NetworkAPI framework, the TE behavior provided by the network operator is expressed as an SRv6 Segment Identifier (SID) in the form of a 128-bit IPv6 address. Because the IPv6 address of an SRv6 SID is distributed using IP anycast, the application can utilize the unchanged SRv6 SID regardless of the application’s location, as if the application controls an API on the transport network. We implement a prototype of the NetworkAPI framework on a Linux kernel. On the prototype implementation, a basic packet forwarding performance is evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework.

Municipal agencies can reduce the use of both man and machine by cutting down their overall waste collection route distance as well as number of waste collection vehicles (WCVs) by deploying this proposed cyber-physical system for route optimization of WCVs with capacitated vehicle-routing model. A novel cost function is mathematically modelled using data from dustbin-sensors and real-time road-traffic with modified Dijkstra's algorithm for optimisation of WCVs routes. Amount of solid waste in the dustbin (GC in %), rate of the filling (ΔG) and real-time/dynamic road traffic information from Google distance matrix advanced application programming interface (API) are used for estimation of the optimised route for WCVs. Optimisation goal of this work is to reduce both capital expense (CapEx) and operational expense (OpEx) of solid waste collection in the city by cutting the WCV fleet size and reducing overall distance covered by WCVs. The proposed route optimisation technique is analytically simulated for Bhubaneswar smart city and the result shows 30.28% saving in overall WCVs route distance and hence reducing OpEx around 29.07% and CapEx around 26.83% by reducing WCV fleet size. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

To protect the social multimedia contents in a network, information security education has been actively studied, and various educational systems are being provided. Even when trainees have completed the training that they can practice, such as DDoS(Distributed Denial of Services) response and database outbreak attack, most of the education methods are based on the theory or advance notification method designed as part of the scenario beforehand and it is difficult to apply these to actual situations. In addition, building new systems and learning to use them for each scenario lowers the training effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate various cases of cyber incident in the content distribution networks. Based on research, we develop Meltdown, Mirai malware, Carbanak APT(Advanced Persistent Threats), and Ransomware scenarios that assume a real multimedia contents distribution situation. We also build and store individual virtual environments for each scenario, integrating them into VMWare ESXI, so that attack and defense practices can be conducted similar to real world networks. The deployed environment is integrated with the Web through the VM API(Virtual Machine Application Programming Interfaces). When the trainee finishes the training, one utilizes the snapshot function of the virtual machine to return the virtual environment to the pre-training state. Trainees do not need to build a virtual environment for each scenario, but they are able to conduct training in an environment similar to a real network by calling a virtual environment with a simple operation from a web browser. Therefore, it is expected that the convenience of trainees and the efficiency of the education will be increased. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Denial-of-service attack; E-learning; Malware; Network security; Virtual machine; Content distribution; Content distribution networks; Distributed denial of service; Education systems; Information security education; Multimedia contents; Scenario; Training effectiveness; Distributed database systems","Case of cyber incident; Education system; Malware; Scenario; Virtual machine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077609593"

Compared to the building industry, the application of BIM tools for tunnel project management is lagging far behind. This paper proposes a methodology for integrating BIM tools for conventional tunnelling. A fundamental distinction is made between the tunnel internal architectural domain and the external structural domain. For the former, BIM methodology can be applied similarly to the building industry. For the latter, it is suggested that a BIM model be built according to the essential information generated during tunnelling excavation. The proposed methodology was put to test for an actual tunneling project. A routine was established where the supervisor on behalf of the owner was responsible for gathering and reporting essential data in tabular form. Via REVIT's Application Programming Interface (API), a code was developed so that a BIM model was built and updated automatic to data insertion. Ultimately, the final BIM model allows managing up-to-date qualitative and quantitative information visually.

To this end, conduction only analytic models offer a viable approach due to the massive drop in computational expense. Here, we extend an existing implementation which uses a governing equation which can be evaluated at any point in space and time. This implementation already utilizes OpenMP with a spatial decompositions scheme stemming from a melt pool tracking algorithm. We then combine this with a parallel in time (PinT) approach to make the problem highly parallelizable. The new scheme, which uses MPI for internode communication and OpenMP for intranode communication, is shown to scale very well across multiple computational nodes. This approach results in the ability to simulate the 3D solidification conditions for entire layers of additively manufactured parts in minutes making part scale thermal simulations more practical. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printers; Additives; Application programming interfaces (API); Computational expense; Computational problem; Heat conduction models; Inter-node communication; Intra-node communication; Solidification condition; Spatial decompositions; Thermal simulations; Heat conduction","Additive manufacturing; Heat conduction; MPI; OpenMP; Parallelization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086587413"

Early diagnosis and isolation are effective and imperative strategies for epidemic prevention and control. Most diagnostic methods for the COVID-19 is based on nucleic acid testing (NAT), which is expensive and time-consuming. To build an efficient and valid alternative of NAT, this article investigates the feasibility of employing computed tomography images of lungs as the diagnostic signals. Unlike normal lungs, parts of the lungs infected with the COVID-19 developed lesions, ground-glass opacity, and bronchiectasis became apparent. Through a public dataset, in this article, we propose an advanced residual learning diagnosis detection (RLDD) scheme for the COVID-19 technique, which is designed to distinguish positive COVID-19 cases from heterogeneous lung images. Besides the advantage of high diagnosis effectiveness, the designed residual-based COVID-19 detection network can efficiently extract the lung features through small COVID-19 samples, which removes the pretraining requirement on other medical datasets. In the test set, we achieve an accuracy of 91.33%, a precision of 91.30%, and a recall of 90%. For the batch of 150 samples, the assessment time is only 4.7 s. Therefore, RLDD can be integrated into the application programming interface and embedded into the medical instrument to improve the detection efficiency of COVID-19.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Nucleic acids; Detection efficiency; Detection networks; Diagnostic methods; Fast transmissions; Ground-glass opacity; Learning diagnosis; Medical data sets; Medical instruments; Diagnosis","Computed tomography (CT) image analysis; convolutional neural network (CNN); COVID-19 diagnosis; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); residual learning diagnosis detection (RLDD)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099733146"

This article presents a suite of simple pervasive serious games we have developed to explore the concept of 'reality-enhanced gaming,' a pattern to tie game play mechanics to the outcomes/measurements of real-world activities. The prototype games were realized in the context of TEAM, an industrial research project aimed at developing apps for flexible and collaborative mobility. The proposed games are examples of different user interfaces we considered useful to meet various significant scenarios, goals and user typologies, especially for improving car driving styles. Given the variety of information sources, contexts of use, and target users, we abstracted a game-oriented framework [Reality-Enhanced AppLied (REAL) games], in order to support reuse and scalability. Through a set of RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs), the REAL framework separates sensor data from actual game implementations, so as to provide different experiences to users, according to their specific needs and preferences. This concept-which allows serious game developers to focus on their specific game logic while seamlessly exploiting a variety of field sensors-is general and may be applied to a variety of domains. We validated REAL developing and field testing five typologies of serious games. Subjective evaluation results show a good level of satisfaction and perceived usefulness. More tests are needed, especially in terms of different application contexts, impact on developers, number and variety of users, and exposure time. However, outcomes confirm the significant potential of reality-enhanced game design and the importance of tools for supporting their development. © 2018 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computation theory; Human computer interaction; Industrial research; User experience; User interfaces; Application contexts; Field sensors; Information sources; Level of satisfaction; Perceived usefulness; Pervasive game; Real-world activities; Subjective evaluations; Serious games","Applied games; automotive; Internet of Things (IoT); pervasive games; RESTful API; serious games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091765367"

Wearable technology has played a significant role in researching and evaluating systems developed for and with the BVIP community. This paper presents a system based on Google Glass designed to assist BVIP with scene recognition tasks, thereby using it as a visual assistant. The camera embedded in the smart glasses is used to capture the image of the surroundings, which is analyzed using the Custom Vision Application Programming Interface (Vision API) from Azure Cognitive Services by Microsoft. The output of the Vision API is converted to speech, which is heard by the BVIP user wearing the Google Glass. A dataset of 5000 newly annotated images is created to improve the performance of the scene description task in Indian scenarios. The Vision API is trained and tested on this dataset, increasing the mean Average Precision (mAP) score from 63% to 84%, with an IoU > 0.5. The overall response time of the proposed application was measured to be less than 1 second, thereby providing accurate results in real-time. A Likert scale analysis was performed with the help of the BVIP teachers and students at the 'Roman Catherine Lobo School for the Visually Impaired' at Mangalore, Karnataka, India.

Fall detection system (FDS) that alerts caregivers or family members can potentially save lives of the elderly. However, conventional FDS involves wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This article presents a passive device-free FDS based on commodity WiFi framework for smart home, which is mainly composed of two modules in terms of hardware platform and client application. Concretely, commercial WiFi devices collect disturbance signal induced by human motions from smart home and transmit the data to a data analysis platform for further processing. Based on this basis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is used to eliminate the influence of random noise presented in the collected data. Next, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is utilized to classify human motions and identify the fall status automatically. By leveraging Web Application Programming Interface (API), the analyzed data is able to be uploaded to the proxy server from which the client application then obtains the corresponding fall information. Moreover, the system has been implemented as a consumer mobile App that can help the elderly saving their lives in smart home, and detection performance of the proposed FDS has been evaluated by conducting comprehensive experiments on real-world dataset.

A version of the filtering algorithm parallelized using the OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) standard is proposed. The algorithm employs a kd-tree structure to skip some unnecessary calculations between cluster centroids and feature vectors. In our approach, both the kd-tree construction and the iterations of the K-means are parallelized using the OpenMP tasking mechanism. A new task is created for a recursive call performed during kd-tree construction and traversal. The tasks are executed in parallel by the cores of a shared-memory system. In computational experiments, we evaluated the parallel efficiency of our approach and compared its performance to the parallel Lloyd's method, a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) formulation of the K-means algorithm, and two parallel triangle inequality-based algorithms intended for low-dimensional data. The evaluation was performed on six synthetic datasets from two distributions and seven real-life datasets. The experiments, executed on a 24-core system, indicated that our version of the filtering algorithm had satisfactory or high parallel efficiency. Its runtime was much shorter than those of competing algorithms.

The method first establishes frequency-domain wind fields, which are then changed to time-domain wind fields using the inverse Fast Fourier Transfer. Finally, interpolation is used to determine the full field unsteady turbulent wind speed. The OpenMP scheme for parallel computing and the skyline method for efficient matrix decomposition sped up 34 times faster than that without these schemes using an eight-core computer. Then, offshore wind turbine (OWT) support structure analyses and designs under International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-3 and realistic tropical cyclone loads were performed for three cases.

However, actual tropical cyclones may cause worse conditions, especially for the yaw always on the X axis. Nevertheless, this actual tropical cyclone condition does not excessively increase the weight of the steel design, so IEC 61400-3 DLCs I.1 and I.2 are sufficient to ensure the safety of the OWT steel design. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Frequency domain analysis; Hurricanes; Inverse problems; Offshore oil well production; Soil structure interactions; Storms; Structural design; Tropics; Turbulence; Wind; Finite elements analysis; International electro-technical commissions; International Electrotechnical Commission; Offshore winds; Openmp parallel computation; Significant wave height; Soil-structure interaction; Tropical cyclone; Wind field; Yaw operative condition; finite element method; offshore structure; significant wave height; software; soil-structure interaction; tropical cyclone; turbulence; wind field; wind turbine; Finite element method","Finite element analysis; Offshore wind turbine; OpenMP parallel computation; Significant wave height; Soil structure interaction; Tropical cyclones; Turbulence; Yaw operative condition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111682484"

To mitigate the ballast damage caused by tamping, an application programming interface was innovatively developed to establish a ballast model that could actually simulate ballast breaking. This model was subsequently verified by a laboratory test. On this basis, a tamper-sleeper-ballast bed coupling model was constructed by the coupling of discrete element method and multibody dynamics. Finally, the coupling model was utilized to analyze the breaking behavior of ballasts in different sections and the influence of ballast properties on particle breakage. The results show that ballasts in the crib are the most probable to be broken in a tamping operation, whose breakage degree is 1.65%. Ballast properties can greatly influence particle breakage in a tamping operation. The recommended critical normal and tangential stresses of ballasts are 45 MPa and 15 MPa, respectively.

The CK concept is to decompose research projects into reusable components that encapsulate research artifacts and provide unified application programming interfaces (APIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), meta descriptions and common automation actions for related artifacts. The CK framework is used to organize and manage research projects as a database of such components. Inspired by the USB 'plug and play' approach for hardware, CK also helps to assemble portable workflows that can automatically plug in compatible components from different users and vendors (models, datasets, frameworks, compilers, tools). Such workflows can build and run algorithms on different platforms and environments in a unified way using the customizable CK program pipeline with software detection plugins and the automatic installation of missing packages. This article presents a number of industrial projects in which the modular CK approach was successfully validated in order to automate benchmarking, auto-tuning and co-design of efficient software and hardware for machine learning and artificial intelligence in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, size and various costs. The CK framework also helped to automate the artifact evaluation process at several computer science conferences as well as to make it easier to reproduce, compare and reuse research techniques from published papers, deploy them in production, and automatically adapt them to continuously changing datasets, models and systems. The long-term goal is to accelerate innovation by connecting researchers and practitioners to share and reuse all their knowledge, best practices, artifacts, workflows and experimental results in a common, portable and reproducible format at cKnowledge.io.

Significantly, at the vast majority of locations worldwide, satellite remote sensing is currently the only source of information to complement much more limited in-situ instrumentation for land and sea mapping, monitoring and measurement. Less well recognised is that publicly available, routinely sampled and now easily accessible optical imagery covering virtually every position along the world's coastlines already spans multiple decades. In the past five years the common obstacles of (1) limited access to high-performance computing and (2) specialist remote sensing technical expertise, have been largely removed. The emergence of several internet-accessible application programming interfaces (APIs) now enable applied users to access petabytes of satellite imagery along with the necessary tools and processing power to extract, manipulate and analyse information of practical interest. Following a brief overview and timeline of civilian Earth observations from space, satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) and satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) are used to introduce and demonstrate some of the present real-world capabilities of satellite optical imagery most relevant to coastal professionals and researchers. These practical examples illustrate the use of satellite imagery to monitor and quantify both engineered and storm-induced coastline changes, as well as the emerging potential to obtain seamless topo/bathy surveys along coastal regions. Significantly, timescales of satellite-derived changes at the coast can range from decades to days, with spatial scales of interest extending from individual project sites up to unprecedented regional and global studies. While we foresee the uptake and routine use of satellite-derived information becoming quickly ubiquitous within the Coastal Engineering profession, on-ground observations are – and in our view will remain - fundamentally important. Compared to precision in-situ instrumentation, present intrinsic limitations of satellites are their relatively low rates of revisit and decimetre spatial accuracy. New satellite advances including ‘video from space’ and the potential to combine Earth observation with numerical and data-driven coastal models through assimilation and artificial intelligence are advances that we foresee will have future major impact in Coastal Engineering. © 2021 The Authors","Satellites; Varanidae; Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Coastal engineering; Earth (planet); Observatories; Optical communication; Professional aspects; Remote sensing; Space optics; Engineering perspective; Engineering profession; High performance computing; Monitoring and measurements; Satellite optical imagery; Satellite remote sensing; Situ instrumentation; Technical expertise; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; bathymetric survey; coast; coastal engineering; instrumentation; precision; remote sensing; satellite imagery; shoreline; site investigation; Satellite imagery","Earth observation; Google earth engine; Remote sensing; Satellite optical imagery; Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB); Satellite-derived shorelines (SDS); Stereoscopy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106393729"

Given the current dependency on traditional transportation data sources and conventional tools (e.g., spreadsheets and propriety models), how can these new resources be used? This research examines a “blended data” approach, using a web-based, open source platform to assist transit agencies to forecast bus ridership. The platform is capable of incorporating new Big Data sources and traditional data sources, using modern processing techniques and tools, particularly Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This research demonstrates the use of APIs in a transit demand methodology that yields a robust model for bus ridership. The approach uses the Census Transportation Planning Products data, modified with American Community Survey data, to generate origin–destination tables for bus trips in a designated market area. Microsimulation models us a transit scheduling specification (General Transit Feed Specification) and an open source routing engine (OpenTripPlanner).

This study contributes to this research trend by constructing a stochastic model based on raw GNSS observation characteristics from Android smartphones and verifying the feasibility of smartphone-based ambiguity fixing in the short-baseline real-time kinematic (RTK) case. This study uses the raw observation standard deviations (ROSTDs) delivered by the Android application programming interface (API) as a stochastic model and takes advantage of the multipath index from the API to rule out unusable observations. As well as these, the ambiguity integer property is investigated by analyzing the residuals of double-differenced carrier-phase observations associated with one smartphone and one geodetic-grade receiver. Furthermore, we note that the carrier-phase observations collected by tested smartphones do not have the integer property but for the Huawei P30 and Xiaomi 8 devices, such an integer property can be successfully recovered by means of detrending. With the use of ROSTD-dependent weighting, we first perform single-point positioning (SPP) and real-time differentition (RTD) using pseudorange observations delivered by the Huawei P30 and Xiaomi 8 devices. The results show that the stochastic model is applicable to the Xiaomi 8. Moreover, the three-dimensional root-mean-square (3D-RMS) errors of the two smartphones for SPP are 1.28 m and 1.96 m, and the 3D-RMS errors for RTD are 0.79 m and 1.64 m, respectively. We next test the RTK positioning performance based on a short-baseline of 882 m using carrier-phase observations with recovered integer ambiguities. For the Huawei P30, the positioning errors achieved were 7.8, 2.4, 1.1 mm for the east, north, and up (ENU) components at the time of first fix while for the Xiaomi 8, the positioning errors achieved were 4.3, 4.2, 4.2 mm for the ENU components at the time of first fix. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Errors; Global positioning system; Smartphones; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Android applications; Carrier-phase observations; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; High precision positioning; Positioning performance; Pseudorange observations; Real time kinematic; Single-point positioning; Android (operating system)","ambiguity fixing; Android smartphones; raw GNSS observations; ROSTD; RTK","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102626121"

Due to the numerically highly demanding nature of these problems, efficient automatic mesh generators and transient solvers are required. To this end, a parallel explicit solver exploiting the advantages of balanced octree meshes is introduced. To avoid the hanging nodes problem encountered in standard finite element analysis (FEA), the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is deployed as a spatial discretization scheme. Consequently, arbitrarily shaped star-convex polyhedral elements are straightforwardly generated. Considering the scaling and transformation of octree cells, the stiffness and mass matrices of a limited number of unique cell patterns are pre-computed. A recently proposed mass lumping technique is extended to 3D yielding a well-conditioned diagonal mass matrix. This enables us to leverage the advantages of explicit time integrator, i.e., it is possible to efficiently compute the nodal displacements without the need for solving a system of linear equations. We implement the proposed scheme together with a central difference method (CDM) in a distributed computing environment. The performance of our parallel explicit solver is evaluated by means of several numerical benchmark examples, including complex geometries and various practical applications. A significant speedup is observed for these examples with up to one billion of degrees of freedom and running on up to 16,384 computing cores. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Crashworthiness; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Linear transformations; Mesh generation; Parallel processing systems; Stiffness matrix; Wave propagation; Dynamic problem; Elasto-dynamics; Explicit dynamics; IS impacts; Mass matrices; Mass-lumping; Massively parallels; Octree mesh; Parallel com- puting; Scaled boundary finite elements methods; Finite element method","Explicit dynamics; Mass lumping; Octree mesh; Parallel computing; Scaled boundary finite element method","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103810346"

State-of-the-art indoor localization systems are coping with the complex non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation which hinders the use of proven multiangulation and multilateration methods, as well as with prohibitive installation costs, computational demands, and energy requirements. In this paper, we present a novel sensor utilizing low-range infrared (IR) signal in the line-of-sight (LOS) context providing high precision angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation. The proposed sensor is used in the pragmatic solution to the localization problem that avoids NLOS propagation issues by exploiting the powerful concept of the wireless sensor network (WSN). To demonstrate the proposed solution, we applied it in the challenging context of the supermarket cart navigation. In this specific use case, a proof-of-concept navigation system was implemented with the following components: IR-AoA sensor prototype and the corresponding WSN used for cart localization, server-side application programming interface (API), and client application suite consisting of smartphone and smartwatch applications. The localization performance of the proposed solution was assessed in, altogether, four evaluation procedures, including both empirical and simulation settings. The evaluation outcomes are ranging from centimeter-level accuracy achieved in static-1D context up to 1 m mean localization error obtained for a mobile cart moving at 140 cm/s in a 2D setup. These results show that, for the supermarket context, appropriate localization accuracy can be achieved, along with the real-time navigation support, using readily available IR technology with inexpensive hardware components. © 2020 by the authors.

By attaching a waveguide to the array, the effective interelement spacing is reduced to half wavelength. This enables grating lobe-free transmit and receive beamforming with a uniform rectangular array of efficient low-cost transducers. The system further includes custom transceiver electronics, an field programmable gate array (FPGA) system-on-chip and a PC for GPU accelerated frequency domain signal processing, consisting of matched filtering, conventional beamforming, and envelope extraction using Nvidia Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and OpenGL for visualization. The uniform rectangular layout allows utilizing multiple transmit and receive methods, known from medical imaging applications. Thus, the system is dynamically adaptable to maximize the frame rate or detection range. One implemented method demonstrates the real-Time capability by transmitting a hemispherical pulse (HP) with a single transducer to irradiate the surroundings simultaneously, whereas all transducers are used for echo reception. The imaging properties, such as axial and lateral resolution, field of view and range of view, are characterized in an anechoic chamber. The object localization is validated for a horizontal and vertical field of view of ±80° and a range of view of 0.5-3 m with 29 frames/s.

Pulmonary diseases such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are already the third leading cause of death in the world, leaving tuberculosis at ninth with 1.7 million deaths and over 10.4 million new occurrences. The detection of lung regions in images is a classic medical challenge. Studies show that computational methods contribute significantly to the medical diagnosis of lung pathologies by Computerized Tomography (CT), as well as through Internet of Things (IoT) methods based in the context on the health of things. The present work proposes a new model based on IoT for classification and segmentation of pulmonary CT images, applying the transfer learning technique in deep learning methods combined with Parzen’s probability density. The proposed model uses an Application Programming Interface (API) based on the Internet of Medical Things to classify lung images. The approach was very effective, with results above 98% accuracy for classification in pulmonary images. Then the model proceeds to the lung segmentation stage using the Mask R-CNN network to create a pulmonary map and use fine-tuning to find the pulmonary borders on the CT image. The experiment was a success, the proposed method performed better than other works in the literature, reaching high segmentation metrics values such as accuracy of 98.34%. Besides reaching 5.43 s in segmentation time and overcoming other transfer learning models, our methodology stands out among the others because it is fully automatic. The proposed approach has simplified the segmentation process using transfer learning. It has introduced a faster and more effective method for better-performing lung segmentation, making our model fully automatic and robust. © 2020 by the authors.

Phase change mechanisms were expanded to include homogeneous nucleation in supersaturated environments, and particle size-dependent vapor condensation and evaporation. Homogeneous nucleation of water droplets was modeled with classical nucleation theory (CNT) and a modified form of nucleation theory published by Dillmann, A., and Meier, G. E. A. (1991, ""A Refined Droplet Approach to the Problem of Homogeneous Nucleation From the Vapor-Phase,""J. Chem. Phys., 94(5), pp. 3872-3884). The Chemkin-Pro homogeneous nucleation module, developed in this work, was validated against published data for nucleation fluxes at varying pressures, temperatures, and vapor concentrations. A newly released feature in Chemkin-Pro enabled particle size-dependent surface reaction rates. A Chemkin-Pro vapor condensation and evaporation module was written and verified with the formulation published in Hinds, W. C. (1999, Aerosol Technology: Properties, Behavior, and Measurement of Airborne Particles, Wiley, New York). Lastly, Chemkin-Pro results for coagulation in the transition regime were verified with the semi-implicit method developed by Jacobson, M. Z. (1999, Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modeling, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY). Good performance was observed for all three Chemkin-Pro modules. This work illustrates the utility of the Chemkin-Pro API, and the flexibility with which models can be developed using surface-kinetics user-routines. This paper illustrates that Chemkin-Pro can be developed to include more physically representative aerosol dynamics processes where rates are defined based on physical and chemical parameters rather than Arrhenius rates. The methods and modules developed in this work can be applied to industrial problems like material synthesis (e.g., powder production), processes involving phase change like heat exchangers, as well as more fundamental scientific processes like cloud physics. © 2020 by ASME.","Aerosols; Application programming interfaces (API); Condensation; Crystallization; Drops; Evaporation; Kinetics; Particle size; Precipitation (meteorology); Reaction rates; Surface reactions; Cambridge university; Classical nucleation theory; Homogeneous nucleation; Phase change mechanisms; Physical and chemical parameters; Semi-implicit methods; Transition regimes; Vapor concentrations; Nucleation","and droplets; bubbles; condensation; evaporation; heat and mass transfer; particles; two-phase flow and heat transfer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104672780"

Video content can be played thanks to GPU decompression, supporting free navigation with full parallax in real-time. To render a novel viewpoint, each selected input view is warped using the camera pose and associated depth map, using an implicit 3D representation. The warped views are then blended all together to generate the chosen virtual view. Various view blending approaches specifically designed to avoid visual artifacts are compared. Using as few as four input views appears to be an optimal trade-off between computation time and quality, allowing to synthesize high-quality stereoscopic views in real-time, offering a genuine immersive virtual reality experience. Additionally, the proposed approach provides high-quality rendering of a 3D scenery on holographic light field displays.

The availability of a large number of Web APIs with diverse functionalities on the Web makes it difficult for users to find APIs meeting their needs for Mashup development. To relieve this difficulty, recommending Web APIs for Mashup development has become an effective solution. A dozen of service recommendation approaches were proposed based on multi-dimensional features extracted from the service repository over the last couple of years, e.g., similarity based matching methods, matrix factorization based models, and factorization machine based models. Among these existing works, Factorization Machine (FM) based models, in particular the deep learning based FM models, have shown better performance compared with other conventional collaborative filtering techniques. Despite their superiority, the deep learning based FMs still have some strong model assumptions that can harm the recommendation accuracy. For example, it models factorized interactions with the same weight and ignores the non-linear and complex inherent structure in data. In a real-world service recommendation scenario, different predictor variables usually have different predictive power and not all features are predictable for estimating the target. Also, higher-order feature interactions are usually underlain in complex user-service environments. To address these deficiencies, this paper proposes a hybrid factorization machine model with a novel neural network architecture, named NAFM, which integrates a deep neural network to capture the non-linear and complex feature interactions and uses an attention mechanism to capture the varying importance of feature interactions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset from ProgrammableWeb. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models for service recommendation. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Complex networks; Frequency modulation; Matrix factorization; Network architecture; Attentional network; Biological system modeling; Doc2vec model; Factorization machines; Features extraction; Hybrid model; Hybrid model.; Mashup applications; Mashups; Neural-networks; Neural networks","Attentional network; Doc2Vec model; Factorization machine; Hybrid model; Mashup application; Neural network","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118655977"

IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work’s main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management application. © 2021 by the authors.

Motivated by this observation, this paper describes a new technique for verifying the correct usage of context-free API protocols. The key idea underlying our technique is to over-approximate the program's feasible API call sequences using a context-free grammar (CFG) and then check language inclusion between this grammar and the specification. However, since this inclusion check may fail due to imprecision in the program's CFG abstraction, we propose a novel refinement technique to progressively improve the CFG. In particular, our method obtains counterexamples from CFG inclusion queries and uses them to introduce new non-terminals and productions to the grammar while still over-approximating the program's relevant behavior. We have implemented the proposed algorithm in a tool called CFPChecker and evaluate it on 10 popular Java applications that use at least one API with a context-free specification. Our evaluation shows that CFPChecker is able to verify correct usage of the API in clients that use it correctly and produces counterexamples for those that do not. We also compare our method against three relevant baselines and demonstrate that CFPChecker enables verification of safety properties that are beyond the reach of existing tools.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","Application programming interfaces (API); Context free grammars; Libraries; Specifications; API calls; Context-free; Context-free specifications; Java applications; Real-world; Refinement techniques; Safety property; Context free languages","Abstraction Refinement; Context-Free API Protocols; Program Verification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099057800"

However, because some studies have not considered comprehensive information that affects house prices, prediction results are not always sufficiently precise. Therefore, we propose an end to end joint self-attention model for house prediction. In this model, we import data on public facilities such as parks, schools, and mass rapid transit stations to represent the availability of amenities, and we use satellite maps to analyze the environment surrounding houses. We adopt attention mechanisms, which are widely used in image, speech, and translation tasks, to identify crucial features that are considered by prospective house buyers. The model can automatically assign weights when given transaction data. Our proposed model differs from self-attention models because it considers the interaction between two different features to learn the complicated relationship between features in order to increase prediction precision. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the performance of the model. Experimental data include actual selling prices in real estate transaction data for the period from 2017 to 2018, public facility data acquired from the Taipei and New Taipei governments, and satellite maps crawled using the Google Maps application programming interface.

Packet classification lies at the core of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based network applications. Due to the increasing speed of network traffic, there is an urgent need for packet classification at higher speeds. Although it is possible to accelerate packet classification algorithms through hardware implementation, this solution imposes high costs and offers limited development capacity. On the other hand, current software methods to solve this problem are relatively slow. A practical solution to this problem is to parallelise packet classification using multi-core processors. In this study, the Thread, parallel patterns library (PPL), open multi-processing (OpenMP), and threading building blocks (TBB) libraries are examined and implemented to parallelise three packet classification algorithms, i.e. tuple space search, tuple pruning search, and hierarchical tree. According to the results, the type of algorithm and rulesets may influence the performance of parallelisation libraries. In general, the TBB-based method shows the best performance among parallelisation libraries due to using a theft mechanism and can accelerate the classification process up to 8.3 times on a system with a quad-core processor. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Libraries; Program processors; Application program interfaces; Classification process; Development capacities; Hardware implementations; Packet classification; Packet classification algorithm; Software defined networking (SDN); Threading building blocks; Multicore programming","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093681729"

Furthermore, being forced into remote learning due to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for innovative learning methods. From our perspective, a learning platform should be reconfigurable to accommodate multiple applications and remotely accessible at any time, from anywhere, and on any connected device. Considering that many of the university courses are now held online, the reliability and scalability of the system become critical. This paper presents the design and development of a wireless configurable myRIO‐based sensor node that connects to SystemLink Cloud. The sensors that were used are for ambient light, temperature, and proximity. A graphical programming environment (G‐LabVIEW) and related APIs were used for rapid concept‐to‐development process. Distinct applications have been developed for the instructor and students, respectively. The students can select which sensor and application to run on the system and observe the measurements on the local student’s application or the cloud platform at a specific moment. They can also read the data on the cloud platform and use them in their LabVIEW application. In the context of remote education, we strongly believe that this platform is and will be suitable for the COVID and Post‐COVID eras as well because it creates a much better remote laboratory experience for stu-dents. In conclusion, the system that was developed is innovative because it is software reconfigu-rable from the device, from the instructor’s application and cloud via a web browser, it is intuitive, and it has a user‐friendly interface. It meets most of the necessary requirements in the current era, being also highly available and scalable in the cloud. © 2021 by the authors.

However, such models are trained with a large amount of sensitive training data, and are typically computationally expensive to build. As a result, many cloud providers (e.g., Google) have launched machine-learning-as-a-service, which helps clients benefit from the sophisticated cloud-based machine learning models via accessing public APIs. Such a business paradigm significantly expedites and simplifies the development circles. Unfortunately, the commercial value of such cloud-based machine learning models motivates attackers to conduct model extraction attacks for free use or as a springboard to conduct other attacks (e.g., craft adversarial examples in black-box settings). In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of existing approaches to model extraction attacks and defenses on cloud-based models. We classify the state-of-the-art attack schemes into two categories based on whether the attacker aims to steal the property (i.e., parameters, hyperparameters, and architecture) or the functionality of the model. We also categorize defending schemes into two groups based on whether the scheme relies on output disturbance or query observation. We not only present a detailed survey of each method, but also demonstrate the comparison of both attack and defense approaches via experiments. We highlight several future directions in both model extraction attacks and its defenses, which shed light on possible avenues for further studies. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Extraction; Speech recognition; Cloud providers; Hyperparameters; Machine learning models; Model extraction; Output disturbance; State of the art; State-of-the-art performance; Training data; Machine learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099018245"

Thickness and configuration of the intermediate layer, i.e. the glass layers, play a vital role in the dwell time of projectile and wave propagation response and optical properties of transparent laminates. In present study, ballistic tests are performed to investigate effects of glass configuration structure, e.g., the thickness of sode-lime glasses, the differences in intrinsic characteristics between the sode-lime glass and the borosilicate glass as well as the thickness of the first backing layer of borosilicate glass on ballistic resistance of the transparent sapphire laminated structures. For further clarify the ballistic resistance mechanism, penetration process and response of two transparent laminated structures with three or two borosilicate glass layers were incorporated in the numerical model, respectively, and analyzed using ABAQUS. As revealed by ballistic and optical tests, a novel lightened transparent sapphire laminated structure against 12.7 mm armor-piercing incendiary (API) with integration of good optical properties was fabricated, demonstrating the widely potential application in defense equipment. It was found that the sapphire/sode-lime glass/PC laminated structure exhibits better ballistic resistance than that of the sapphire/borosilicate glass/PC laminated structure.

In contrast to other state-of-the-art pose estimation approaches for spaceborne applications, the SPN method does not require the formulation of hand-engineered features and only requires a single grayscale image to determine the pose of the spacecraft relative to the camera. The SPN method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with three branches to solve the problem of relative attitude estimation. The first branch of the CNN bootstraps a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to detect a 2-D bounding box around the target spacecraft in the input image. The region inside the 2-D bounding box is then used by the other two branches of the CNN to determine the relative attitude by initially classifying the input region into discrete coarse attitude labels before regressing to a finer estimate. The SPN method then estimates the relative position by using the constraints imposed by the detected 2-D bounding box and the estimated relative attitude. Further, with the detection of 2-D bounding boxes of subcomponents of the target spacecraft, the SPN method is easily generalizable to estimate the pose of multiple target geometries. Finally, to facilitate integration with navigation filters and perform continuous pose tracking, the SPN method estimates the uncertainty associated with the estimated pose. The secondary contribution of this article is the generation of the Spacecraft PosE Estimation Dataset (SPEED), which is used to train and evaluate the performance of the SPN method. SPEED consists of synthetic as well as actual camera images of a mock-up of the Tango spacecraft from the PRISMA mission. The synthetic images are created by fusing OpenGL-based renderings of the spacecraft's 3-D model with actual images of the Earth captured by the Himawari-8 meteorological satellite. The actual camera images are created using a seven degrees-of-freedom robotic arm, which positions and orients a vision-based sensor with respect to a full-scale mock-up of the Tango spacecraft with submillimeter and submillidegree accuracy. The SPN method, trained only on synthetic images, produces degree-level relative attitude error and cm-level relative position errors when evaluated on the actual camera images with a different distribution not used during training. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cameras; Convolutional neural networks; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Image segmentation; Mockups; Object detection; Space applications; Uncertainty analysis; Different distributions; Navigation filters; Object detection algorithms; Relative position and attitude; Relative positions; Spaceborne applications; Target spacecraft; Vision-based sensors; Space rendezvous","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097033529"

Geomagnetic storm induces global ionospheric disturbances, severely affect radio communications and human space activities, e.g., earth observation, deep space exploration, and space weather monitoring and prediction. Monitoring ionospheric anomalies are critical to improve the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) and provide early-warning of disaster service during the extreme space weather event. The spatial and temporal variation of ionospheric electron density (IED) is utilized to characterize the ionospheric anomalies respond to storm. Thus, the global-scale three-dimensional (3-D) ionospheric model is constructed by computerized ionospheric omography (CIT) technique combine multi-GNSS(GPS/GLONASS/BDS/Galileo) and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation (RO) measurements. As ground-based multi-GNSS and space-based Low Earth Orbit (LEO)/GNSS observation networks expand gradually, massive measurements are employed in ionospheric inversion in high temporal-spatial resolution. Hence, the Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) parallel computing method is applied to improve the efﬁciency of imaging 3-D ionosphere. The processing time reduces to within 10 mins, thus 3-D ionospheric model updates in near real-time is achievable. Moreover, the 3-D IED model is applied to monitor the ionosphere dynamically during storms and the storm-induced ionospheric anomalies are observed. This contribution suggests our reconstructed 3-D model is capable of reﬂecting the ionospheric anomalies during storm in global-scale, also it reveals the characteristics of the ionosphere respond to the storm and its evolution. © 2021.

The thermal analysis of battery packs is carried out numerically using the finite volume method. Single and multi-objective optimization of thermal management characteristics, namely maximum temperature (Tb, max), average Nusselt number (Nuavg), and coefficient of friction (Fcavg) using Cuckoo search (CS) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is attempted.

Nuavg and Fcavg are not affected by Cr and Qgen, while Tb, max changes significantly. Ws, Pr, and Re impact these characters differently, demanding the need for optimization.

We identify a class of geometry bugs that arise from confusing which coordinate system a vector belongs to. These bugs are not ruled out by current languages for vector-oriented computing, are difficult to check for at run time, and can generate subtly incorrect output that can be hard to test for. We introduce a type system and language that prevents geometry bugs by reflecting the coordinate system for each geometric object. A value's geometry type encodes its reference frame, the kind of geometric object (such as a point or a direction), and the coordinate representation (such as Cartesian or spherical coordinates). We show how these types can rule out geometrically incorrect operations, and we show how to use them to automatically generate correct-by-construction code to transform vectors between coordinate systems. We implement a language for graphics programming, Gator, that checks geometry types and compiles to OpenGL's shading language, GLSL. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Gator can raise the level of abstraction for shader programming and prevent common errors without inducing significant annotation overhead or performance cost. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Program debugging; Co-ordinate system; Coordinate representations; Correct-by-construction; Graphics programming; Level of abstraction; Shader programming; Shading languages; Spherical coordinates; Geometry","computer graphics; geometry; language design; type systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097575955"

However, most developments of resources and methods in machine reading comprehension have been investigated using two resource-rich languages, English and Chinese. This article proposes a system called ViReader for open-domain machine reading comprehension in Vietnamese by using Wikipedia as the textual knowledge source, where the answer to any particular question is a textual span derived directly from texts on Vietnamese Wikipedia. Our system combines a sentence retriever component, based on techniques of information retrieval to extract the relevant sentences, with a transfer learning-based answer extractor trained to predict answers based on Wikipedia texts. Experiments on multiple datasets for machine reading comprehension in Vietnamese and other languages demonstrate that (1) our ViReader system is highly competitive with prevalent machine learning-based systems, and (2) multi-task learning by using a combination consisting of the sentence retriever and answer extractor is an end-to-end reading comprehension system. The sentence retriever component of our proposed system retrieves the sentences that are most likely to provide the answer response to the given question. The transfer learning-based answer extractor then reads the document from which the sentences have been retrieved, predicts the answer, and returns it to the user. The ViReader system achieves new state-of-the-art performances, with values of 70.83% EM (exact match) and 89.54% F1, outperforming the BERT-based system by 11.55% and 9.54% , respectively. It also obtains state-of-the-art performance on UIT-ViNewsQA (another Vietnamese dataset consisting of online health-domain news) and BiPaR (a bilingual dataset on English and Chinese novel texts). Compared with the BERT-based system, our system achieves significant improvements (in terms of F1) with 7.65% for English and 6.13% for Chinese on the BiPaR dataset. Furthermore, we build a ViReader application programming interface that programmers can employ in Artificial Intelligence applications. © 2021 - IOS Press.

However, building information modelling (BIM) has been mostly used for as-built models of a building, not yet been widely used by designers during project and construction phases for occupational risks prevention and safety planning. This paper aims to show the capacity of developing tools that allow adding functionalities to Revit software to improve safety procedures and reduce the time spent on modelling them during the design phase. Design/methodology/approach: To reach this objective, a structural 3D model of a building is used to validate the developed tools. A plugin prototype based on legal regulations was developed, allowing qualitative safety assessment through the application of job hazard analysis (JHA), SafeObject and checklists. These tools allow the automated detection of falls from height situations and the automated placement of the correspondent safety systems. Findings: Revit application programming interface allowed the conception and addition of several functionalities that can be used in BIM methodology, and more specifically in the prevention of occupational risks in construction, contributing this paper to the application of a new approach to the prevention through design. Originality/value: This paper is innovative and important because the developed plugins allowed: automated detection of potential falls from heights in the design stage; automated introduction of safety objects from a BIM Safety Objects Library; and the intercommunication between a BIM model and a safety database, bringing JHA integration directly on the project. The prototype of this work was validated for fall from height hazards but can be extended to other potentials hazards since the initial design stage. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D modeling; Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Construction; Hazards; Information theory; Laws and legislation; Occupational risks; Occupational therapy; Risk assessment; Software prototyping; Adding functionality; Automated detection; Automated placements; Building Information Modelling; Construction phasis; Design/methodology/approach; Job hazard analysis; Threedimensional (3-d); Architectural design","Accidents; Automated hazards detection; BIM; Building; Building information modelling; Civil engineering and surveying; Construction 4.0; Construction technology; Fall hazard; Health and safety; Prevention; Risk assessment/risk management; Safety","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094145611"

Recently, smart distributed energy resources have been equipped with functionality needed to participate on frequency reserves. Key categories of such resources include photovoltaic systems, batteries, and smart loads. Most of these resources are small and cannot provide the minimum controllable power required to participate on frequency reserves. Thus, virtual power plants have been used to aggregate the resources and trade them on the frequency reserves markets. The information technology aspects of virtual power plants are proprietary and many of the details have not been made public. The first contribution of this article is to propose a generic data model and application programming interface for a virtual power plant with the above-mentioned capabilities. The second contribution is to use the application programming interface to cope with the unpredictability of the frequency reserve capacity that the photovoltaic systems and other distributed energy resources are able to provide to the frequency reserves markets in the upcoming bidding period.

In these developments, the contracts are often disputed in the acceptance due to the fact that the contract specification is not clear, resulting in a great deal of discussion of the gray area. Such disputes often occur in the acceptance processes of smart buildings, mainly because most intelligent building systems are expensive and the operations of the sub-systems are very complex. This paper proposes SpecTalk, a platform that automatically generates the code to conform IoT applications to the Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) specifications. SpecTalk generates a program to accommodate the application programming interface of the IoT devices under test (DUTs). Then, the devices can be tested by SpecTalk following the TAICS data formats. We describe three types of tests: self-test, mutual-test, and visual test. A self-test involves the sensors and the actuators of the same DUT. A mutual-test involves the sensors and the actuators of different DUTs. A visual-test uses a monitoring camera to investigate the actuators of multiple DUTs. We conducted these types of tests in commercially deployed applications of smart campus constructions. Our experiments in the tests proved that SpecTalk is feasible and can effectively conform IoT implementations to TACIS specifications. We also propose a simple analytic model to select the frequency of the control signals for the input patterns in a SpecTalk test. Our study indicates that it is appropriate to select the control signal frequency, such that the inter-arrival time between two control signals is larger than 10 times the activation delay of the DUT. © 2021 by the authors.

Typically, the movements of these entities in the simulation are governed by some pre-defined algorithms (e.g., car-following models and lane-changing models). Modelers may develop customized algorithms through an application programming interface (API). In comparison to the human-controlled vehicles, however, any algorithm will fall short. Other than the configuration of some simplified behavioral parameters (e.g., reaction time), most of the existing MTS models have limited human-in-the-loop simulation abilities to capture the interactions among simulated entities. Besides, most existing MTS models do not provide a realistic virtual environment that enables high-fidelity simulations of the driver behavior in response to various driving conditions, such as road and weather conditions. This paper aims to develop a framework for improving MTS models and extending their capabilities by incorporating distributed vehicles controlled by human-in-the-loop with virtual reality (VR) technologies. This framework supports not only multiple/many users from geographically distributed locations but also interactive visualizations with VR devices from the perspective of a driver and other users (e.g., pedestrians). Data collected from the user-controlled vehicles can be used to calibrate different algorithms like car following, lane changing, etc., or to explore the virtual world from different perspectives for design investigation by potential stakeholders.

Neither is scalable to support the expected 10x increase in active spacecraft population in less than 10 years, nor does it support automated maneuver planning. We present a software prototype of an STM architecture based on open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and drawing on insights from NASA's architecture for low-altitude Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management. The STM architecture is designed to provide structure to the interactions between spacecraft operators, various regulatory bodies, and STM service suppliers, while maintaining flexibility of these interactions and the ability for new market participants to enter easily. Autonomy will be an indispensable part of the proposed architecture in enabling efficient data sharing, coordination between STM participants and safe flight operations (e.g. select spacecraft maneuvers to prevent impending conjunctions between multiple spacecraft). The STM prototype is based on modern micro-service architecture adhering to OpenAPI standards and deployed in industry-standard virtualized containers, facilitating easy communication between different participants or services. The system architecture is designed to facilitate adding and replacing services with minimal disruption. We have implemented some example participant services (e.g. a space situational awareness/SSA provider, a conjunction assessment supplier/CAS, an automated maneuver advisor/AMA) within the prototype. Different services, with creative algorithms folded into them, can fulfill similar functional roles within the STM architecture by flexibly connecting to it using pre-defined APIs and data models, thereby lowering the barrier to entry of new players in the STM marketplace. We demonstrate the STM prototype on a multiple conjunction scenario with multiple maneuverable spacecraft, where an example CAS and AMA can recommend optimal maneuvers to the spacecraft operators, based on a pre-defined reward function. Such tools can intelligently search the space of potential collision avoidance maneuvers with varying parameters like lead time and propellant usage, to optimize a customized reward function, and be implemented as a scheduling service within the STM architecture. The case study shows an example of autonomous maneuver planning using the API-based framework. As satellite populations and predicted conjunctions increase, an STM architecture can facilitate seamless information exchange related to collision prediction and mitigation among various service applications on different platforms and servers. The availability of such an STM network also opens up new research topics on satellite maneuver planning, scheduling and negotiation across disjoint entities. © 2020 IAA","Antennas; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Commerce; Computer systems programming; Data Sharing; NASA; Network architecture; Object oriented programming; Scheduling; Service industry; Software prototyping; Spacecraft; Traffic control; Collision avoidance maneuver; Conjunction assessments; Information exchanges; Open application programming interface; Proposed architectures; Space situational awareness; Space traffic management; Unmanned aerial systems; Computer architecture","Decision making under uncertainty; Space debris; Space traffic; Spacecraft management; Trajectory optimization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098872566"

However, it is generally time-and energy-intensive to initialize all nodes in a UWASN due to unstable underwater channel conditions. To improve network efficiency, we propose the Application-based Partial Initialization (API) protocol, which initializes only the same number of nodes as the number of activated nodes required to run a specific application. Reducing the number of active nodes is also particularly advantageous underwater since the replacement of batteries is costly. To the best of our knowledge, the API is the first approach that initializes nodes partially according to applications. Thus, we investigate the feasibility of the API for a UWASN by analyzing its performance via simulations. From the results, it is shown that the API provides similar data statistics compared with the conventional full initialization that initializes all nodes. Moreover, the API outperforms the full initialization in terms of the initialization time and message overhead performances. © 2020 by the authors.

However, preparing these lift studies can be time-consuming. Hence, automating this process is a great step in saving time, and reducing the percentage of errors, having the practitioner focus on lift planning rather than tedious tasks. A significant step in the pre-construction and construction phase of an industrial project is creating the 4D animation of lift processes. Such an animation develops a better understanding of the process and streamlines finding the best path for the mobile crane movements to avoid collisions. Such a 4D lift animation (i.e., simulation) can be a mandate when the lifting process is performed in a congested construction site involving more than one crane. This research study aims to propose a comprehensive framework for creating the 4D animation of a multi mobile crane lift process. The proposed approach can connect to a comprehensive model, in Building Information Modeling (BIM) terminologies, or can auto-generate the simplified CAD model containing the lifting objects (i.e., modules in modular construction) and obstructions by interacting with a central database. It can also auto-generate the 3D model of cranes in the set and pick positions. Then, the lift animation can be developed quickly in an automated manner by employing a customized Application Programming Interface (API). The developed API generates the lift animation of the cranes based on the defined timeline and lifting path by reading the required data (e.g., site information, modules information, cranes information, object models, and lift sequences) from the database. The proposed framework is validated by applying in a portion of a real modular industrial project in Alberta, Canada. The results show that the developed system has enough flexibility to simulate multi-mobile crane movements with various types of mobile cranes, multiple kinds of movements, and various site conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D modeling; Animation; Application programming interfaces (API); Architectural design; Computer aided design; Elevators; Information theory; Modular construction; Alberta , Canada; Building Information Model - BIM; Comprehensive model; Construction phase; Construction sites; Industrial projects; Research studies; Site information; Cranes","4D animation; Automation; Building Information Modeling (BIM); Crane management; Lift plan","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086403057"

A 4-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) method is used for the time integration and OpenMP is used to parallelize the solver. This is used as a platform to compare Van Leer's Flux Vector Splitting Method (VLFVSM) to a variant of Liou's Advection Upstream Splitting with velocity and pressure diffusion (AUSM +-up2). The code results are validated for wall bounded flows. Menter's k−ω Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model is employed and validated for turbulent flows. The SST turbulence model is selected due to its capability to predict the shock location and separation location in adverse pressure gradient accurately. The validation cases are laminar and turbulent incompressible flows and turbulent supersonic flow over flat plate, transonic flow over an axisymmetric bump, and supersonic flow over a blunt bi-conic configuration. It is observed that VLFVSM+SST lacks accurate viscous prediction capability for the wall-bounded flows at low speeds compared to AUSM +-up2+SST, which works well at low speed.

The importance of motifs has led many researchers to develop different tools and algorithms for finding them. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new algorithm to increase the speed and accuracy of the motif discovering process, which is the main drawback of motif discovery algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: All motifs are sorted in a tree-based indexing structure where each motif is created from a combination of nucleotides: ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘T’ and ‘G’. The full motif can be discovered by extending the search around 4-mer nucleotides in both directions, left and right. Resultant motifs would be identical or degenerated with various lengths. Findings: The developed implementation discovers conserved string motifs in DNA without having prior information about the motifs. Even for a large data set that contains millions of nucleotides and thousands of very long sequences, the entire process is completed in a few seconds. Originality/value: Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed implementation; as for a real-sequence of 1,270,000 nucleotides spread into 2,000 samples, it takes 5.9 s to complete the overall discovering process when the code ran on an Intel Core i7-6700 @ 3.4 GHz machine and 26.7 s when running on an Intel Xeon x5670 @ 2.93 GHz machine. In addition, the authors have improved computational performance by parallelizing the implementation to run on multi-core machines using the OpenMP framework. The speedup achieved by parallelizing the implementation is scalable and proportional to the number of processors with a high efficiency that is close to 100%. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Application programming interfaces (API); Efficiency; Indexing (of information); Nucleotides; Computational performance; Design/methodology/approach; Indexing structures; Multi-core machines; Parallel implementations; Prior information; Regulatory motifs; Tree-based algorithms; Trees (mathematics)","Genetic network; Multi-core; OpenMP; Optimization; Parallel processing; Regulation motif","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087091193"

How to recommend accurate and appropriate Web APIs to mashups has become a focus and difficulty in the field of service computing. The existing methods are mainly based on collaborative filtering technology, but these methods have problems such as the data sparsity and cold start, which leads to poor recommendation effects. This paper proposes a service recommendation model based on knowledge graph and collaborative filtering. In this model, the knowledge graph connects the APIs and mashups related information to mine the potential relations between mashups and APIs, hence reducing the impact of data sparsity. All the API entities in the service knowledge graph are embedded into the low-dimensional space through the representation learning algorithm, then the distances between the API vectors are calculated to recommend the related APIs. In addition, in order to solve the cold-start problem of recommending APIs to target mashups that have no APIs usage, the similarities of functional sets extracted from mashups are calculated to recommend APIs for target mashups. At the same time, the model obtains the Mashup-API usage record, using the technology of collaborative filtering to recommend appropriate APIs to target mashups. Finally, the similarities of the above recommended APIs are normalized and sorted to form the final recommendation result. The experimental results show that our proposed model significantly improves the accuracy of service recommendation.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Graph algorithms; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Vector spaces; Cold start problems; Data sparsity; Knowledge graphs; Low-dimensional spaces; Model-based OPC; Service computing; Service recommendation algorithm; Service recommendations; Collaborative filtering","collaborative filtering; knowledge graph; representation learning; Web API recommendation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103791237"

Therefore, a significant number of algorithms have been developed to perform rigid and non-rigid image registration. Particularly, the free-form deformation algorithm is frequently used to carry out non-rigid registration task; however, it is a computationally very intensive algorithm. In this work, we describe an approach based on profiling data to identify potential parts of this algorithm for which parallel implementations can be developed. The proposed approach assesses the efficient of the algorithm by applying performance analysis techniques commonly available in traditional computer operating systems. Hence, this article provides guidelines to support researchers working on medical image processing and analysis to achieve real-time non-rigid image registration applications using common computing systems. According to our experimental findings, significant speedups can be accomplished by parallelizing sequential snippets, i.e., code regions that are executed more than once. For the selected costly functions previously identified in the studied free-form deformation algorithm, the developed parallelization decreased the runtime by up to seven times relatively to the related single thread based implementation. The implementations were developed based on the Open Multi-Processing application programming interface. In conclusion, this study confirms that based on the call graph visualization and detected performance bottlenecks, one can easily find and evaluate snippets which are potential optimization targets in addition to throughput in memory accesses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Deformation; Image analysis; Image registration; Medical imaging; Real time systems; Free-form deformation; Image processing and analysis; Image registration algorithm; Medical image analysis; Medical image registration; Medical images processing; Nonrigid image registration; Performances analysis; Profiling tools; Real time performance; Computer operating systems","Medical image processing and analysis; Non-rigid image registration; Performance analysis; Profiling tools","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118383046"

Synchronous APIs involve straightforward sequential control flow that makes them easy to use and understand, but their ""blocking""behavior may result in poor responsiveness or performance. Asynchronous APIs impose a higher syntactic burden that relies on callbacks, promises, and higher-order functions. On the other hand, their nonblocking behavior enables applications to scale better and remain responsive while I/O requests are being processed. While it is generally understood that asynchronous APIs have better performance characteristics, many applications still rely on synchronous APIs. In this paper, we present a refactoring technique for assisting programmers with the migration from synchronous to asynchronous APIs. The technique relies on static analysis to determine where calls to synchronous API functions can be replaced with their asynchronous counterparts, relying on JavaScript's async/await feature to minimize disruption to the source code. Since the static analysis is potentially unsound, the proposed refactorings are presented as suggestions that must be reviewed and confirmed by the programmer. The technique was implemented in a tool named Desynchronizer. In an empirical evaluation on 12 subject applications containing 316 synchronous API calls, Desynchronizer identified 256 of these as candidates for refactoring. Of these candidates, 244 were transformed successfully, and only 12 resulted in behavioral changes. Further inspection of these cases revealed that the majority of these issues can be attributed to unsoundness in the call graph.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","Application programming interfaces (API); High level languages; Applications programming interfaces; Asynchronous Javascript; Asynchronous programming; Blocking behaviour; Control-flow; Higher order functions; Javascript; Performance; Refactorings; Sequential control; Static analysis","Asynchronous Programming; JavaScript; Refactoring; Static Analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117613132"

Despite many technological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used functions within traffic modeling, the volume-delay function has seen little in the way of change since it was developed in the 1960s. Traditionally macroscopic methods have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular journey time. The general nature of these functions enables their ease of use and gives widespread applicability. However, they lack the ability to consider individual road characteristics (i.e., geometry, presence of traffic furniture, road quality, and surrounding environment). This research investigates the feasibility to reconstruct the model using two different data sources, namely the traffic speed from Google Maps' Directions Application Programming Interface (API) and traffic volume data from automated traffic counters (ATC). Google's traffic speed data are crowd-sourced from the smartphone Global Positioning System (GPS) of road users, able to reflect real-time, context-specific traffic condition of a road. On the other hand, the ATCs enable the harvesting of the vehicle volume data over equally fine temporal resolutions (hourly or less). By combining them for different road types in London, new context-specific volume-delay functions can be generated. This method shows promise in selected locations with the generation of robust functions. In other locations, it highlights the need to better understand other influencing factors, such as the presence of on-road parking or weather events.  © The Author(s), 2020.","Application programming interfaces (API); Crowdsourcing; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Speed; Traffic congestion; Case-studies; Crowd-sourced data; Delay function; Real-time traffic datum; Sensor; Statistic modeling; Traffic analysis; Traffic data; Traffic modeling; Traffic speed; Global positioning system","Crowd-sourced data; GPS; real-time traffic data; sensors; statistical modeling; traffic analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119179951"

There have been some approaches proposed for APIs recommendation, but the existing approaches focus on the utilization of historical invocation records but ignore the exploitation of other information in the development process. We find that this ignored information can be mined as cognitive knowledge to learn the behavior rules of developers. In this article, we propose a holistic personalized recommendation framework that contains two individual models and one ensemble model, which are based on joint matrix factorization and cognitive knowledge mining. In the two individual models, we study the hidden relationships among users, which are mined from the APIs following records. We also study the hidden relationships among APIs, which are mined from the content information. We also propose an ensemble model.

Here, we present an open-source computational platform named as ALKEMIE, acronyms for Artificial Learning and Knowledge Enhanced Materials Informatics Engineering, which enables easy access of data-driven techniques to broad communities. ALKEMIE is incorporated with three key components for the computational design of materials for the forthcoming data-driven sciences: data generation via high-throughput calculations, data management and data mining via machine learning models. Briefly speaking, the high-throughput calculations in ALKEMIE are implemented through the integration of automatic frameworks of model constructions, calculation performances and data analysis. And the used high-level application programming interface for the database makes the data mining through machine learning more applicable in material science.

Methods: First, the API interface of Sina Weibo is utilized to obtain the information of users in Sina Weibo; then, the Excel software is utilized to sort and analyze the extracted data to extract the features of micro- blogs posted by users. Second, SVM and KNN algorithms are utilized to calculate the weighted average and propose a hybrid multi-classifier-based Mixed Classifier Emotion Prediction Model (MCEPM). Finally, through the evaluation criteria, including precision (P), recall rate (R), and harmonic average (F1), the specific experimental results of SVM and KNN weight coefficients are compared with the prediction results of MCEPM. Results: The prediction effect of MCEPM is associated with the weight coefficients of SVM and KNN. If the weight coefficients of SVM and KNN are 0.6 and 0.4, the prediction effect of MCEPM will be optimal. Comprehensive analysis shows that the MCEPM model can balance the prediction results of the positive and negative samples of the two classifiers. Conclusion: MCEPM model is superior to other algorithms in micro-blog emotion prediction, which can help enterprises analyze users' product inclination and provide accurate customer service requirements for enterprises.  © 2021 - IOS Press.

It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over $100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges. In this paper we propose a high-level ecosystem approach that integrates societal values with digital affordances of industry’s cognitive-assisted processes, remote interfacing, hybrid applications and large-scale value networks. Early development of an Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) is presented as the key enabling framework for Industry Commons interoperability and a series of enabling frameworks form the basis of future research directions in Trusted Data Sharing and Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management for greater sustainability.

Inner corrosion problems in product oil pipelines are widespread but have not received attention, and high strength product oil pipelines are rarely used in China. In this paper, morphology and composition analysis and electrochemical methods were used to study the corrosion behaviors and characteristics of API 5L X65, X70 and X80 steel product oil pipelines. The feasibility of using high strength product oil pipelines in the transportation environment of product oil under the condition of inner corrosion is discussed, and the support for the safe operation of product oil pipelines is provided. The research results show that X80 pipeline steel has advantages over X65 and X70 pipeline steel. In the simulated liquid system of sediments in product oil pipeline, as the immersion time increases, the corrosion rate of X65, X70 and X80 pipeline steels shows a trend from high to low. Morphological analysis and electrochemical analysis showed that X80 pipeline steel showed better performance and adaptability to the environment, and its aerobic corrosion reaction was slower than that of X65 and X70 pipeline steel. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that the three pipeline steels have the same corrosion mechanism, and all of them form Fe2O3, FeOOH, FeCO3, and FeS. The corrosion process is similar but the speed is different. This is attributed to the more corrosion-resistant trace elements in the X80 pipeline steel composition and the structure more compact. The application of high strength API 5L X80 steel in the product oil pipeline is still in its infancy, and it will be more practical to accelerate the development of API 5L X80 steel to make it more applicable to the construction of product oil pipelines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Hematite; High strength steel; Petroleum industry; Petroleum pipelines; Petroleum transportation; Steel corrosion; Steel pipe; Trace elements; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Corrosion mechanisms; Corrosion-resistant; Electrochemical analysis; ELectrochemical methods; Morphological analysis; Morphology and composition; Pipe-line transportations; X80 pipeline steels; Pipeline corrosion","Corrosion mechanism; Electrochemistry; High strength product oil pipelines; Inner corrosion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086515485"

In this paper, we present CruParamer, a deep neural network based malware detection approach for Windows platform that performs learning on sequences of parameter-augmented APIs. It first employs rule-based and clustering-based classification to assess the sensitivity of a parameter to malicious behaviour, and further labels the API following the run-time parameters with varying degrees of sensitivities. Then, it encodes the APIs by concatenating the native embedding and the sensitive embedding of labelled APIs, for characterizing the relationship between successive labelled APIs and their correspondence in terms of security semantics. Finally, it feeds the sequences of API embedding into the deep neural network for training a binary classifier to detect malware. In addition to presenting the design, we have implemented CruParamer and evaluated it on two datasets. The results demonstrate that CruParamer outperforms naïve models when taking raw APIs as input, proving the effectiveness of CruParamer.

The inclusion of electric propulsion and the promise of autonomy to simplify flight operations could provide benefits that lead to wider use of small aircraft for regional transportation. The effort here presents a computational analysis framework to evaluate three different modes of transportation (airline, automobile, and air taxi); the air taxi service options consider different conventional takeoff and landing aircraft options powered by either conventional fuels or electricity with various levels of autonomy to assess potential advantages. The framework is developed in two variants: a specific trip model and a generic trip model. The specific trip approach leverages Google Maps and Rome2Rio application programming interfaces for driving and flight information, respectively, whereas the generic approach uses curve-fit/approximate models derived from the specific trip model for rapid calculations of trip time and cost for various system-level market studies. Potential market sensitivity study reveals that the inclusion of distributed propulsion, autonomy, ride-sharing, and aircraft production rate all impact the market attractiveness of the on-demand air taxi operations. Of these, an increased level of autonomy and the ability to facilitate ride-sharing are the two most important factors that affect the market attractiveness of regional air mobility. © AIAA International.

This requires the information systems that support such processes to interoperate. Significant attention has been paid to the development of ontology-based solutions, which are meant to tackle issues from inconsistency to semantic interoperability and knowledge reusability. This paper looks into how the available technology, models and ontology-based solutions might interact within the manufacturing industry environment to achieve semantic interoperability among industrial information systems. Through a systematic literature review, this paper has aimed to identify the most relevant elements to consider in the development of an ontology-based solution and how these solutions are being deployed in industry. The research analyzed 54 studies in alignment with the specific requirements of our research questions.

Self-driving networks possess the key properties to overcome such challenges. We present and implement a management system that addresses several elements of a self-driving network. Our system leverages intents, a policy-based paradigm and autonomic control loops. Intent-based networking allows us to formalize how an intent can be provided as input to a control loop, and how the complexities can be abstracted from the user. To realize and assure the intent, autonomic networking enables us to create Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE) loops. Finally, we execute the control loops using a policy-based approach. We propose a policy abstraction to support requirements at different levels of abstraction, and an Application Programming Interface (API) layer to reduce management complexity from the user perspective. We propose a formal policy information model to model policies across layers of abstractions and to support simplified mapping and strong consistencies among various policy abstraction levels.

Combining the processing power of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with matching algorithms seems a natural alternative to speedup the string-matching process. This work proposes a Parallel Rabin-Karp implementation (PRK) that encompasses a fast-parallel prefix-sums algorithm to maximize parallelization and accelerate the matching verification. Given an input text T of length n and p patterns of length m, the proposed implementation finds all occurrences of p in T in O(m + q + nτ + nmq ) time, where q is a sufficiently large prime number and τ is the available number of threads. Sequential and parallel versions of the PRK have been implemented. Experiments have been executed on p ≥ 1 patterns of length m comprising of m = 10, 20, 30 characters which are compared against a text string of length n = 227.

In general, the mass–spring system is applied to real-time cloth simulation with three types of springs. However, hard spring cloth simulation using the mass–spring system requires a small integration time-step in order to use a large stiffness coefficient. Furthermore, to obtain stable behavior, constraint enforcement is used instead of maintenance of the force of each spring. Constraint force computation involves a large sparse linear solving operation. Due to the large computation, we implement a cloth simulation using adaptive constraint activation and deactivation techniques that involve the mass–spring system and constraint enforcement method to prevent excessive elongation of cloth. At the same time, when the length of the spring is stretched or compressed over a defined threshold, adaptive constraint activation and deactivation method deactivates the spring and generate the implicit constraint. Traditional method that uses a serial process of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) to solve the system in every frame cannot handle the complex structure of cloth model in real-time. Our simulation utilizes the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) parallel processing with compute shader in OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) to solve the system effectively. In this paper, we design and implement parallel method for cloth simulation, and experiment on the performance and behavior comparison of the mass–spring system, constraint enforcement, and adaptive constraint activation and deactivation techniques the using GPU-based parallel method. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

However, the public's spatial experience, social behavior and aesthetic needs in sky gardens have not been thoroughly explained. This paper takes Singapore, which has a rich social public space in the air, as an example where studies estimating spatial perception have used networked images instead of user preference survey results. Manual image identification and image recognition were performed with a computer vision application programming interface (API) to recognize networked images. Then, we extracted the sky gardens’ main elements in Singapore’s urban environment using clustering analysis, principal component analysis and factor analysis with SPSS. Finally, we discuss the spatial distribution, role and composition of sky gardens in high-density cities and people’s emotional preferences. The study shows that sky gardens are effective alternative public spaces in Singapore's vertical city, and their physical elements occupy a dominant position in the public’s spatial perception; there is a strong tendency for different buildings’ sky gardens to have spatial demand characteristics, while public facilities and cultural activities are key factors that affect sky gardens’ quality. © 2021 The Author(s).

The software is part of the Engineering Technology Internet of Things (IoT) System, interfacing with other software, and also capable of direct hardware interfacing for data retrieval and system control. It is fully web-based, used real time, and used in RTOC (Real-Time Operating Center) of IoT system, which is a software system for drilling process remote monitor and decision. WebDrillingViz uses the most frontier HTML5 technology to realize a brand-new drilling 3D visualization system. The front end is designed in single-page application (SPA) mode and adopts technologies such as angular, bootstrap, and WebGL. The front-end uses single page application (SPA) mode, Angular, Bootstrap, WebGL and other technologies are used. The back-end data services provide data interface support for front-end visualization applications based on HTTP protocol which uses NodeJS, a lightweight development platform suitable for cloud platform, and Restify to realize a REST JSON API. Both sides are using the same object-oriented oriented development language-TypeScript. The front-end develops an easy-To-extend 3D visualization class library based on WebGL for drilling. It is encapsulated as Angular modularization to form an Angular component, which can be used standalone or integrated into other Angular applications. At the same time, the back-end microservice architecture combined with container and cloud technology is easy to maintain, deploy, and expand and has the advantages of being lightweight, cross-platform, flexible, and efficient. Using HTML5 standard and Bootstrap's responsive layout achieves cross-platform, which can support different operating systems and screen sizes. The system has better robustness and maintainability, thanks to the object-oriented and strong typing characteristics of TypeScript. Practical application shows that WebDrillingViz is efficient, capable of visualization of large drilling 3D scene, and compatible with mainstream devices, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. The use of open standards-based modern web technologies and data format enables a more lightweight and economical solution. WebGL, Angular, NodeJS, and TypeScript formed a powerful technology stack, which can be used as an excellent reference for other browser-based visualization development.  © 2021 Shanshan Liu et al.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Data visualization; HTML; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Infill drilling; Modular construction; Object oriented programming; Search engines; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3-D visualization systems; Cloud technologies; Development platform; Internet of Things (IOT); Operating centers; Software programming; System architecture design; Visualization application; Internet of things","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106352958"

Although actor concurrency may be less susceptible to some multithreaded concurrency bugs, such as low-level data races and deadlocks, it comes with its own bugs that may be different. However, the fundamental characteristics of actor concurrency bugs, including their symptoms, root causes, API usages, examples, and differences when they come from different sources are still largely unknown. Actor software development can significantly benefit from a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative understanding of these characteristics, which is the focus of this work, to foster better API documentation, development practices, testing, debugging, repairing, and verification frameworks. To conduct this study, we take the following major steps. First, we construct a set of 186 real-world Akka actor bugs from Stack Overflow and GitHub via manual analysis of 3,924 Stack Overflow questions, answers, and comments and 3,315 GitHub commits, messages, original and modified code snippets, issues, and pull requests. Second, we manually study these actor bugs and their fixes to understand and classify their symptoms, root causes, and API usages. Third, we study the differences between the commonalities and distributions of symptoms, root causes, and API usages of our Stack Overflow and GitHub actor bugs. Fourth, we discuss real-world examples of our actor bugs with these symptoms and root causes. Finally, we investigate the relation of our findings with those of previous work and discuss their implications. A few findings of our study are: (1) symptoms of our actor bugs can be classified into five categories, with Error as the most common symptom and Incorrect Exceptions as the least common, (2) root causes of our actor bugs can be classified into ten categories, with Logic as the most common root cause and Untyped Communication as the least common, (3) a small number of Akka API packages are responsible for most of API usages by our actor bugs, and (4) our Stack Overflow and GitHub actor bugs can differ significantly in commonalities and distributions of their symptoms, root causes, and API usages. While some of our findings agree with those of previous work, others sharply contrast. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Application programming interfaces (API); Software design; Software testing; Verification; Concurrency bugs; Development practices; Fundamental characteristics; Manual analysis; Multithreaded; Software systems; Stack overflow; Verification framework; Program debugging","Actor bug API usages; Actor bug differences; Actor bug root causes; Actor bug symptoms; Akka actor bugs; GitHub; Stack Overflow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097572262"

This paper aims to provide an efficient framework to handle mismatches between these two models with the least negative impact on the whole project. Design/methodology/approach: First, 11 most frequent mismatches were identified through questionnaires. Also, the respondents were asked to determine the mismatches’ roots and solutions and the impact of applying solutions on the whole project. Afterward, the process to present the optimum solution to one of these mismatches was modeled. After running the application programming interface developed in Navisworks software, decision-makers access a form, showing mismatches, their causes and solutions, as well as the solutions’ effect. To finalize the optimal solution, a platform was provided on whether to accept the system solution or to propose an alternative. Findings: To empirically validate the reliability of the proposed framework, two projects were investigated. Two different approaches to dealing with the same mismatch occurred in these projects were compared in terms of time, cost and material required. The results showed that addressing the mismatches through the proposed framework can efficiently enhance time, cost and material consumption, in comparison with the traditional approach.

Bridge rehabilitation projects have complex constraints and multiple participants. Constraint management is critical for such projects. Integrating and searching for relevant information is a key step for constraint management to timely remove constraints. However, accessing project information still relies on manual searching, which can delay information flow in constraint management and hinder constraint removal. Thus, this study introduces the concrete bridge rehabilitation project management ontology (CBRPMO) to improve information integration and constraint management. The CBRPMO was created by comprehensively collecting domain knowledge of bridge rehabilitation and following standard procedures. Reasoning rules were combined with an application programming interface (i.e. OWL API) to enable functions not supported in traditional ontologies (e.g. temporal computation and dynamic updating). As such, the CBRPMO can effectively handle dynamic information in ongoing projects. The CBRPMO was validated in a case study. The results show that the CBRPMO can: 1) integrate project information of constraints, tasks and procedures, participants, and relations between these project entities; 2) support various management functions based on dynamic project information, including evaluating project progress, constraint removal, and participants' performance. The CBRPMO contributes to the industry by: 1) extending the application of ontologies in the bridge sector to cover the rehabilitation stage; 2) enhancing functions of conventional ontologies; and 3) reducing information searching time compared to manual searching, which improves constraint management approaches by automating the information searching step. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bridges; Concrete bridges; Concretes; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Project management; Application of ontologies; Bridge rehabilitation; Complex constraints; Constraint management; Information integration; Information searching; Management functions; Project informations; Information management","Bridge rehabilitation; Constraint management; Ontology; OWL API; Semantic reasoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096531182"

Lack of such a comprehensive decision-making framework which utilizes BIM, Management Information Systems (MIS), simulation, and automation tools to choose between different construction alternatives have been addressed in the research background. As an example of decision-making objective, optimized smart building's equipment combination for a certain project should be selected in the feasibility study phase. In this research, a comprehensive decision-making framework was developed to choose smart building's equipment based on energy consumption and cost trade-off. Subsequently, smart building alternatives were considered as a decision-making example to choose the best alternative using BIM, MIS and simulation tools. The research contributes to the automating of some parts of the decision-making framework by developing an Application Programming Interface (API). This API helps with making the appropriate automating permutation out of possible options, totalizing the cost of each combination and sorting data in the research database developed for the recommended framework. This framework, database and API can be used similarly for any other decision making objective. Finally, a model representing the average conditions of residential buildings in Tehran was developed to choose the optimized smart building's equipment combination of 31 considered options. This optimized combination which included all possible smart building options except for smart lighting has an investment return of about 7.5 years which is more than that of similar projects in other countries due to Iran's low energy carrier tariff. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Architectural design; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Information management; Investments; Architectural , engineering and constructions; Building Information Modelling; Decision-making frameworks; Energy consumption and cost; Feasibility studies; Management information system (MIS); Optimized combinations; Residential building; Decision making","Automated decision-making framework; Building information modelling (BIM); Energy-cost optimization; Management information systems (MIS); Smart building's equipment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091576753"

Programming such systems is still a challenging task and developers rely often on standard parallel APIs and frameworks such as OpenMP and OpenCL. These tools, however, present some limitations when more than one algorithm has to be accelerated. The typical workload of a software radio usually includes several compute-intensive algorithms so it might be still better served by more specific tools, especially on embedded platforms. In this article, a development methodology for implementing software radio applications in heterogeneous multicore embedded platforms is proposed. The methodology is based on GNU radio, a free and open source software toolkit. To validate the methodology, a DVB-T receiver has been ported to an embedded heterogeneous multicore platform as a proof-of-concept. The results show that two different compute-intensive algorithms, Viterbi decoder, and FFT, can be simultaneously accelerated, improving the DVB-T receiver performance by 63%.  © 2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Multicore programming; Open systems; Software radio; Communications equipment; Computational requirements; Development methodology; Embedded platforms; Free and open source softwares; Heterogeneous multi core processors; Heterogeneous Multi-Cores; Software radio applications; Open source software","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089287596"

Managing knowledge in the IWs domain is complex; however, promoting knowledge sharing based on standards and common terms agreeable to all players is essential and is something that must be established. In this context, ontologies, as a conceptual tool and a key component of knowledge-based systems, have been used by organizations for effective knowledge management, better decision-making, and interoperability among diverse institutions of an IWs domain. The development of ontology involves structural and logical complexity, and requires a well-designed, mature, and widely accepted methodology, to ensure its reliability. Many methodologies for ontology development have been proposed by several researchers; however, most of the developed methodologies have not included several important phases. Furthermore, several methodologies have not provided the complete details of the techniques and activities involved in the ontology construction process. Fewer details make it difficult to follow a methodology for designing ontologies. This study aims to compare existing methodologies based on sixteen important criteria and proposes an improved methodology for ontology development for IWs domains. The proposed methodology has included several important phases such as the Estimation of Human Resources, Re-engineering and Re-using of Resources, Collaborative Ontology Construction, the Conceptualization of both Endurants and Perdurants, Localization of an Ontology, Ontology Integration and Merging, Support for Interoperability, Versioning of an Ontology, and Ontology Population. The proposed methodology has been applied to design an OntoWM domain ontology for the Waste Management (WM) domain. The evaluation of the proposed methodology has been made by utilizing the designed OntoWM domain ontology in an ontology-based web application called SmartBinAnalytics. SmartBinAnalytics has been built using OntoWM, Java Server Pages (JSP), Jena Application Programming Interface (API), and MySQL.

A hybrid MPI + OpenMP parallel computing model is applied and it is proved to be able to obtain a more effective parallel performance on high performance computing(HPC) systems. A series of cases with the total pressure of 1 MPa, 1.5 MPa, 2 MPa, and the equivalence ratio of 0.9, 1, 1.4 are simulated. On one hand, the total pressure shows a significant impact on the instabilities of rotating detonation waves. The instability phenomenon is observed in cases with low total pressure (1 MPa) and weakened with the increase of the total pressure. The total pressure has a small impact on the detonation wave velocity and the specific impulse. On the other hand, the equivalence ratio shows a negligible influence on the instabilities, while it affects the ignition process and accounts for the detonation velocity deficit. It is more difficult to initiate rotating detonation waves directly in the lean fuel operation condition. Little difference was observed in the thrust with different equivalence ratios of 0.9, 1, and 1.4. The highest specific impulse was obtained in the lean fuel cases, which is around 2700 s. The findings could provide insights into the understanding of the operation characteristics of kerosene/air RDE. © 2020 The Authors","Aircraft engines; Application programming interfaces (API); Detonation; Kerosene; Shock waves; Wave propagation; Detonation velocity deficits; Detonation wave velocity; High performance computing systems; Operation characteristic; Operation conditions; Parallel computing models; Parallel performance; Propulsive performance; Combustion knock","Equivalence ratio; Instabilities; Kerosene/air rotating detonation waves; MPI+OpenMP; Total pressure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092500869"

This article explores fact-checking initiatives in Latin America, using an original Markov-based computational method to cluster topics on tweets and identify their diffusion between different datasets. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our article proposes an in-depth tracing of COVID-related false information across the region, comparing if there is a pattern of behavior through the countries. We rely on the open Twitter application programming interface connection to gather data from public accounts of the six major fact-checking agencies in Latin America, namely Argentina (Chequeado), Brazil (Agência Lupa), Chile (Mala Espina Check), Colombia (Colombia Check from Consejo de Redacciín), Mexico (El Sabueso from Animal Polótico) and Venezuela (Efecto Cocuyo). In total, these profiles account for 102,379 tweets that were collected between January and July 2020. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of online information dissemination beyond the national level and demonstrates how politics intertwine with the health crisis in this period.

However, after data cleaning, 13,635 tweets were considered for analysis. The objectives of the study are to identify (1) the topics users tweet about sustainable consumption and (2) to detect the emotion-based sentiments in the tweets. The study used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling and the Louvain algorithm for semantic network clustering. NRC emotion lexicon was used for sentiment analysis. The LDA model discovers six topics: organic food consumption, food waste, vegan food, sustainable tourism, sustainable transport, and sustainable energy consumption. While the Louvain algorithm detects four clusters—lifestyle and climate change, responsible consumption, energy consumption, and renewable energy, sentiment analysis results show more positive emotions among the users than the negative ones.

One such new trend that promises the endurance is the Cloud computing. Computing resources offered by the Cloud includes the servers, networks, storage, and applications, all as services. With the advent of Cloud, a single application is delivered as a metered service to numerous users, via an Application Programming Interface (API) accessible over the network. The services offered via the Cloud are such as the infrastructure, software, platform, database and web services. The main motivation of this application model is to provide computationally secure key generation to protect the data via encryption. This key generation in the cryptography process falls into three categories in this research work. In the first part, SVM based encryption service model is constructed for which the key generation is from the conventional encryption operation mode with some improvements. To make the process more complex, the optimization techniques are taken into account for the key generation in descendant two methods application model that acts computationally more secure specifically for Cloud environment. The results of security analysis confirm the effectiveness of the proposed application model withstands potentially against various attacks such as Chosen Cipher Attack, Chosen Plain text Attack indistinguishable attacks for files. In case of images, it resists well against statistical and differential attacks.

However, there is a rapid rise of malware applications in Android platform in the recent past years due to its security vulnerabilities. The existing static malware detection mechanisms can locate malicious components associated with the source code of an application and dynamic analysis can identify exploits in the runtime environment. Hence, the advantages of both static and dynamic mechanisms need to be combined to form a hybrid analysis mechanism for achieving better accuracy in malware detection. The existing machine learning based hybrid malware analysis mechanisms do not check the interdependency of static and dynamic features used in their machine learning classifiers. This interdependency can lead to multicollinearity problem which can affect the classifier's performance. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel TAN (Tree Augmented naive Bayes) based hybrid malware detection mechanism by employing the conditional dependencies among relevant static and dynamic features (API calls, permissions and system calls) which are required for the functionality of an application. We trained three ridge regularized logistic regression classifiers corresponding to API calls, permission and system calls of an application and modeled their output relationships as a TAN (Tree Augmented naive Bayes) for identifying whether the application is malicious or not. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can detect malicious applications over a long period with an accuracy of 0.97. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Classifiers; Dynamics; Forestry; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Malware; Android platforms; Classifier's performance; Logistic regression classifier; Multicollinearity; Runtime environments; Security vulnerabilities; Static malware detections; Tree augmented Naive Bayes; Mobile security","Android malware; Hybrid analysis; Tree augmented naive bayes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084956476"

The ability to scale the solution to large problem sizes is traced back to an adimensionalization process combined with the use of mixed-precision data types that reduce memory pressure and improve arithmetic intensity, judicious use of the memory ecosystem on GPU cards as exposed by CUDA on Nvidia architectures, and a software implementation that prioritizes execution speed over modeling generality. The simulation approach is demonstrated for 3D scenarios with up to 710 million bodies for the frictionless case (of relevance in emulsions), and up to 210 million bodies for scenarios with friction (of relevance in terradynamics, additive manufacturing, soft-matter physics). The frictional contact model used draws on the Discrete Element Method (DEM). A performance benchmark shows linear scaling with problem size up to GPU memory capacity. The implementation has an application programming interface that enables it to interact in a cosimulation framework with third-party dynamics engines. This interaction is anchored by a force–displacement data exchange protocol that brings in external bodies as geometries defined by triangle meshes. We demonstrate the cosimulation mechanism by interfacing to an open source, multiphysics simulation engine called Chrono. Therein, triangular meshes define moving boundary conditions for Chrono::Granular, which in turn provides forces and torques acting on the triangular meshes. Several tests are considered for validation and scaling analysis purposes. The limiting aspects of the current implementation are its exclusive support of monodisperse granular systems, and its lack of handling geometries beyond spheres. These limitations are addressed by ongoing work. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Electronic data interchange; Engines; Finite difference method; Friction; Open source software; Adimensionalization; Data exchange protocols; Frictional contact model; Moving boundary conditions; Multiphysics simulations; Simulation approach; Soft-matter physics; Software implementation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","Discrete element method; Friction and contact; GPU parallel computing; Granular material; Many-body dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086024749"

In the rapid development of 3D film and television, the situation of scene design and production has also become an important role. In a typical environment, the main scene plays the role of film and television and coherent plot. This thesis mainly analyzes the design and implementation of a 3D movie scene production algorithm based on the Internet of Things and also makes 3D movie scenes through the algorithm of Internet of Things technology. This article also analyzes the traditional 3D scene-making algorithm, which is mainly composed of a plane mapping part, a basic primitive generation part, a collision detection and positioning part, and a terrain generation part. Among them, the plane mapping technology provides the function of using plane mapping to simulate 3D objects. The basic primitive generation part uses the OpenGl function to draw 3D primitives and paste the BMP format image on each surface of the stereo primitives, so that the 3D model can be represented by a plane texture; collision detection is a key part of mechanical physics, which can detect games of the physical edge of the object in the middle; the terrain generation part uses the converted gray height value as the corresponding grid terrain height and uses planar mapping technology to capture the image of the entire terrain, that is, paste and generate a terrain map. The results show that a characteristic of the algorithm of the Internet of Things technology is that the 3D scene is completely mapped. This avoids the trouble of using 3DMAX and other tools to create 3D models and also reduces the difficulty of creating 3D scenes and makes the execution efficient, which is better than directly importing 3D models, runs faster, and runs very smoothly. The Internet of Things is an important development trend in the Internet information age and can be used to produce 3D film and television scenes to reduce development difficulty and cost and has a variety of research and development value and practical value. In the analysis part, this article also introduces the algorithms used in the scene production and passes the tests of 4 different files in 4 different frames and also found that more than 83% of people feel that the use of Internet of Things algorithms in the production of 3D movie scenes has improved production efficiency. © 2021 Ruiying Kuang.","3D modeling; Application programming interfaces (API); Entertainment industry; Internet of things; Landforms; Mapping; Motion pictures; Product design; Textures; Collision detection; Design and implementations; Digital technologies; Internet information; Internet of things technologies; Production efficiency; Research and development; Terrain generations; Three dimensional computer graphics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114649659"

However, there is actually little empirical evidence concerning the scale of that effect. While many models of bike-sharing travel patterns include station locations, only a few have accounted for heterogeneity in service levels. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the case of the bike-sharing system in the city of Poznań (536,000 inhabitants). We hypothesise that a higher number of bike-sharing trips could be found in places with a higher frequency of public transport. A model based on trips data mined through a web application programming interface (over 19,240,000 GPS recorded bicycle positions), and open public transport frequency data from the general transit feed specification is used. Regression results show that while including control variables and spatial effects, the frequency of public transport was significantly associated with the number of bike-sharing trips. A positive effect existed for short and medium trips, whereas no relationship was found for long trips. Findings support the view that public transport frequency is a relevant factor for bike-sharing which should be taken into account in planning. © 2021 The Author(s)","Poland [Central Europe]; Poznan [Poland]; Application programming interfaces (API); Control variable; Higher frequencies; Model-based OPC; Public transport; Sharing systems; Station location; Travel patterns; WEB application; cycle transport; data mining; empirical analysis; numerical model; public transport; regression analysis; sustainability; Bicycles","Big data; Bike-sharing; Data mining; Multimodal travel; Public transport; Spatial regression","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100237577"

The development of schemes in automatic defeaturing, gaps repairing, and intersection removal usually requires a discrete representation of the geometry. However, existing surface meshing methods could not effectively handle sliver surfaces and assemblies with complex contact conditions, including multiple misaligned curves/surfaces and degenerated or free-form-shaped interface of contact. A surface meshing method based on a meshing-and-synchronizing strategy is proposed, which tackles the mesh generation of sliver surfaces and the cleanup of misaligned assemblies by means of mesh alignment. The mesh generation is performed in a hierarchical manner with curves and surfaces being meshed in sequence. By incorporating the synchronization strategy into the curve/surface meshing process, curve/surface mesh alignment is achieved automatically without compromising the mesh quality. Thanks to the alignment, the curve mesh generated by aligned curve meshing (ACM) is free of intersections, which enhances the meshing of sliver surfaces. By enforcing mesh alignment, aligned surface meshing (ASM) can handle misaligned assemblies with complex contact conditions. ASM is parallelized by using OpenMP. Various assemblies characterized with difficult misaligned features and touches are well processed by parallel ASM. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Alignment; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer aided design; Product design; Computer aided design models; Contact conditions; Curves and surfaces; Mesh alignment; Meshing process; Self-intersections; Surface meshing; Synchronization strategies; Mesh generation","assembly cleanup; finite element mesh generation; mesh alignment; parallel algorithms; surface patch meshing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104227579"

A faceted model is employed that tracks which elements of a time-varying geometry are exposed to the sunlight, but sunlight reflections are not modeled. The method uses the highly parallel execution capabilities of commodity graphics processing unit (GPU) and the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) and Open Compute Language (OpenCL) to render a spacecraft mesh on the GPU. A custom-developed OpenGL render pipeline computes the per-model facet SRP forces and torques that are summed on the GPU before the resultant spacecraft force and torque vectors are copied back to the CPU bound process. The process is validated on spherical and cubic test shapes. The evaluation accommodates spacecraft self-shadowing and is capable of accounting for arbitrary spacecraft articulation. Material properties are encoded with the model to provide realistic specular, diffuse, and absorption surface light interactions. Numerical simulations illustrate the impact of geometric fidelity and articulated surfaces.

Extensive literature review followed by semi-structure interviews of 21 industry experts were carried out to identify the issues faced by construction stakeholders in managing construction delays. To resolve these issues, a plugin named BIM-based Construction Delays Recorder (BIM-CDR) is developed using Application Programming Interface (API) of the most commonly used BIM software i.e. Autodesk Revit. BIM-CDR provides a centralized repository, encompassing detailed information related to delays, which can be retrieved and visualized to analyze their impact on delay claims. To assess the effectiveness of BIM-CDR, a feasibility study is conducted with the experts’ review panel. The results revealed that BIM-CDR can record wide-ranging information related to all the significant issues causing delays on construction sites, and can help in effectively managing their corresponding claims. The advantages of the developed prototype include visualization of delays’ location, facilitation of delay analysis and effective delays management. Moreover, it also promotes transparency and speedy settlement of delay related claims without any unwanted disputes. COPYRIGHT: © 2021 The author(s).

As a result, Open Banking has become an emerging concept, which provides third-party financial service providers open access to bank APIs, including consumer banking, transaction, and other financial data. However, such openness may also incur many security issues, especially when the data can be exposed by an API to a third party. Focused on this challenge, the primary goal of this work is to develop one innovative web solution to the market. We advocate that the solution should be able to trigger transactions based on goals and actions, allowing users to save up money while encouraging positive habits. In particular, we propose a solution with an architectural model that ensures clear separation of concern and easy integration with Nordea's (the largest bank in the Nordics) Open Banking APIs (sandbox version), and a technological stack with the microframework Flask, the cloud application platform Heroku, and persistent data storage layer using Postgres. We analyze and map the web application's security threats and determine whether or not the technological frame can provide suitable security level, based on the OWASP Top 10 threats and threat modelling methodology. The results indicate that many of these security measures are either handled automatically by the components offered by the technical stack or are easily preventable through included packages of the Flask Framework. Our findings can support future developers and industries working with web applications for Open Banking towards improving security by choosing the right frameworks and considering the most important vulnerabilities.  © 2021 Deina Kellezi et al.","Application programming interfaces (API); Digital storage; Architectural modeling; Bank accounts; European union; Financial data; Financial services providers; Model-view-controller architectures; OpenAccess; Security issues; Third parties; Web solutions; Bottles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116664583"

The huge data obtained from the experimental readings is found to be highly non-linear using the data visualization technique. The energy output from the CCPP reduces linearly with the temperature and non-linearly with pressure. A mathematical model is developed for the predictions of the energy output. Modelling using sequential API and functional API based artificial neural network (SANN and FANN) having single hidden layer is carried out. Finally, energy output modelling using sequential API and functional API based deep ANN (SDNN and FDNN) is also performed. The residuals of the predicted and experimental observations indicate that the error is acceptable and it lies uniformly above and below the regression line. The R-squared value of the mathematical model is 0.93 and 0.94 during training and testing. The obtained R-squared value of the ANN and DNN using sequential and functional API is 0.94. The training and testing of all the models are successful and these models have shown a great compatibility in predicting the energy output of a CCPP. The ANN model with single layer and deep layer has no difference in accuracy hence the former one is recommended as it is computationally less expensive. © 2021 The Author","Application programming interfaces (API); Combined cycle power plants; Data visualization; Deep learning; Forecasting; Fossil fuel power plants; Multilayer neural networks; Ambient pressures; Combined cycle; Combined-cycle power plant; Energy output; Learning models; Modeling; Neural-networks; Thermal parameters; Thermal-power plants; Training and testing; Thermoelectric power plants","Energy output; Modelling; Neural networks; Power plant; Thermal parameters","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120896494"

The key idea is to couple SPHinXsys, an open-source multi-physics library in unified smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) framework, with Simbody which presents an object-oriented application programming interface for multi-body dynamics. More precisely, the wave dynamics and its interaction with OWSC is resolved by a Riemann-based weakly-compressible SPH method in SPHinXsys, and the solid-body kinematics is computed by Simbody library. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed solver can accurately predict the wave elevations, flap rotation and wave loading on the flap in comparison with laboratory experiment and numerical investigation. In particularly, the new solver shows optimized computational performance through CPU cost analysis and comparison with commercial software package ANSYS FLUENT and other SPH-based solvers in literature. Furthermore, a linear damper is applied for imitating the power take-off system to study its effects on the hydrodynamics properties of OWSC and efficiency of energy harvesting. In addition, the present solver is used to model extreme wave condition using the focused wave approach to investigate the extreme loads and motions of OWSC under such extreme wave conditions. It is also worth noting that though the model validation used herein is a bottom hinged oscillating wave energy converter (WEC), the obtained numerical results show promising potential of the proposed solver to future applications in the design of high-performance WECs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Energy harvesting; Hydrodynamics; Lagrange multipliers; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Power takeoffs; Extreme waves; Lagrangian; Oscillating wave surge converter; Oscillating wave surge converters; Simbody; Smoothed particle hydrodynamic; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Wave energy converter; Wave interactions; Wave-structure interaction; hydrodynamics; Lagrangian analysis; performance assessment; smoothing; wave modeling; wave-structure interaction; Wave energy conversion","Oscillating wave surge converter (OWSC); Simbody; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH); Wave energy converter (WEC); Wave-structure interaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111498887"

Examples of CPS interacting with humans in industrial production environments are the so-called cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), where operators supervise the industrial machines, according to the human-in-the-loop paradigm. In this scenario, research challenges for implementing CPPS resilience, promptly reacting to faults, concern: (i) the complex structure of CPPS, which cannot be addressed as a monolithic system, but as a dynamic ecosystem of single CPS interacting and influencing each other; (ii) the volume, velocity and variety of data (Big Data) on which resilience is based, which call for novel methods and techniques to ensure recovery procedures; (iii) the involvement of human factors in these systems. In this paper, we address the design of resilient cyber-physical production systems (R-CPPS) in digital factories by facing these challenges. Specifically, each component of the R-CPPS is modelled as a smart machine, that is, a cyber-physical system equipped with a set of recovery services, a Sensor Data API used to collect sensor data acquired from the physical side for monitoring the component behaviour, and an operator interface for displaying detected anomalous conditions and notifying necessary recovery actions to on-field operators. A context-based mediator, at shop floor level, is in charge of ensuring resilience by gathering data from the CPPS, selecting the proper recovery actions and invoking corresponding recovery services on the target CPS. Finally, data summarisation and relevance evaluation techniques are used for supporting the identification of anomalous conditions in the presence of high volume and velocity of data collected through the Sensor Data API. The approach is validated in a food industry real case study. © 2021, The Author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Embedded systems; Recovery; Context-Aware; Context-aware resilience; Cyber physicals; Data relevance; Data summarizations; Digital factories; Human-in-the-loop; Production system; Resilient cybe-physical production system; Smarter machines; Cyber Physical System","Big Data; Context-aware resilience; Data relevance; Data summarisation; Digital factory; Human-in-the-loop; Resilient cyber-physical production system; Smart machine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116928987"

To clarify the rules governing the structure and distribution of rice roots, the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates and morphological parameters of rice roots were measured in hydroponic experiments at different growing periods, and the rice root structure was measured with a high degree of accuracy. The initial position, growth direction, and rate were then determined via statistical analysis of the data. In this article, a 3D rice root growth model based on the differential L-system is proposed; in this system, the biological characteristics based on the topological structure and the actual growth laws of rice roots are quantified. We adopted the growing degree day (GDD) as the driving factor that describes the growth law of rice roots and tested the accuracy of the model output. In this model, a 3D visualization of the growth simulation system of rice roots is implemented via Visual C++ and the OpenGL standard library on the basis of algorithms for the constructed 3D rice root growth model. The model output realistically recreates the dynamic growth process of rice roots under different conditions. A large amount of experimental data and comparative analysis show that the average accuracies achieved by the proposed system concerning total root length, root surface area and root volume are 96.95%, 95.97%, and 93.98%, respectively. These results verify the high reliability of the constructed model and the effective simulation of the morphological characteristics and growth laws of rice roots at different growth periods, laying the foundation for future research on the laws of changes in morphological structure and the physiological and ecological factors of rice roots at different growth stages. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","3D modeling; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer software; Cultivation; Forestry; Physiological models; Topology; Visualization; Biological characteristic; Different growth stages; High degree of accuracy; Morphological characteristic; Morphological parameters; Morphological structures; Three dimensional (3D) coordinates; Three dimensional visualization; Three dimensional computer graphics","Differential L-system; Rice roots; Simulation; Three-dimensional growth model; Visualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098912966"

In addition, they are increasingly being integrated in data centers and clouds such that they can be used to accelerate data intensive workloads. Under a number of scenarios the GPU can be shared between multiple applications at a fine granularity allowing a spy application to monitor side channels and attempt to infer the behavior of the victim. For example, OpenGL and WebGL send workloads to the GPU at the granularity of a frame, allowing an attacker to interleave the use of the GPU to measure the side-effects of the victim computation through performance counters or other resource tracking APIs. We demonstrate the vulnerability by implementing three end-to-end attacks. We show that an OpenGL or CUDA based spy can fingerprint websites accurately (attack I), track user activities within the website, and even infer the keystroke timings for a password text box (attack II) with high accuracy. The third attack demonstrates how a CUDA spy application can derive the internal parameters of a neural network model being used by another CUDA application on the cloud. To counter these attacks, the paper suggests mitigations based on limiting the rate of the calls, or limiting the granularity of the returned information. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Websites; Computing devices; Data-intensive workloads; Fine granularity; High-accuracy; Internal parameters; Multiple applications; Neural network model; Performance counters; Side channel attack","GPU; keystroke timing attack; side channels; website fingerprinting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112104155"

Locations of officially registered mines and dams were obtained from the Brazilian government open data resource. Multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, obtained and processed at the Google Earth Engine platform, was used to train and test deep neural networks using the TensorFlow 2 application programming interface (API) and Google Colaboratory (Colab) platform. Fully convolutional neural networks were used in an innovative way to search for unregistered ore mines and tailing dams in large areas of the Brazilian territory. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by the discovery of 263 mines that do not have an official mining concession. This exploratory work highlights the potential of a set of new technologies, freely available, for the construction of low cost data science tools that have high social impact. At the same time, it discusses and seeks to suggest practical solutions for the complex and serious problem of illegal mining and the proliferation of tailings dams, which pose high risks to the population and the environment, especially in developing countries. © 2020 by the authors.

For this purpose, we have conducted a case study over a social media trend on Twitter and proposed a set of analytical metrics that can assist Twitter developers in making their social platform more informative and interactive.

The basic research includes finding users who triggered the online trend, featuring the popularity of the trend, acquiring the location of users who mentioned the hashtag, and detecting the devices that have been used frequently to tweet on the trend. We proposed to the developers advanced solutions with more insightful analytics, which involves the identification of users whose content received maximum reach and reveals influential users' popularity amongst others tweeting with the same hashtag.

The harmonics elimination has emerged as a topic of prime importance for researchers and industry to realize the maintenance of power quality in the light of the 7th Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper imple-ments a Hybrid Shunt Active Harmonic Power Filter (HSAHPF) to reduce harmonic pollution. An ANN-based control algorithm has been used to implement Hardware in the Loop (HIL) configuration, and the network is trained on the model of pq0 theory. The HIL configuration is applied to integrate a physical processor with the designed filter. In this configuration, an external microprocessor (Rasp-berry PI 3B+) has been employed as a primary data server for the ANN-based algorithm to provide reference current signals for HSAHPF. The ANN model uses backpropagation and gradient descent to predict output based on seven received inputs, i.e., 3-phase source voltages, 3-phase applied load currents, and the compensated voltage across the DC-link capacitors of the designed filter. Moreover, a real-time data visualization has been provided through an Application Programming Interface (API) of a JAVA script called Node-RED. The Node-RED also performs data transmission between SIMULINK and external processors through serial socket TCP/IP data communication for real-time data transceiving. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a real-time Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for testing HSAHPF using the topology based on HIL topology that enables the control algorithms to run on an embedded microprocessor for a physical system. The presented results validate the proposed design of the filter and the implementation of real-time system visualization. The statistical values show a significant decrease in Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) from 35.76% to 3.75%. These values perfectly lie within the set range of IEEE standard with improved stability time while bearing the computational overheads of the microprocessor. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to reproduce the entire process of landslide-induced surge, by taking full advantage of material point method (MPM) in simulating large deformation of soil and gravity-driven flow of water, the two-phase double-point material point method (TPDP-MPM) was extended: a new algorithm handling the boundary without setting boundary particles was proposed. The classical submarine block-induced surge test and sand column collapse experiment were numerically simulated by the MPM and verified the effectiveness of the program. After that, the multiphase coupling process of Lituya Bay landslide-induced surge was simulated and verified the reliability of the TPDP-MPM code, which have achieved parallel computing by making use of OpenMP model. By comparing the results of numerical simulation with the model experiment, the two-phase double-point material point method can well simulate the starting, propagation, run-up and reflux stage of landslide-induced surge.

The IoT-supported devices capacitate, embedded with sensors, enabled numerous context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. There are some activity recognition applications; however, they are still deficient in recognizing activities accurately. In this paper, a novel framework for human activity recognition (HAR) is proposed using raw readings from a combination of fused smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and Google Fit activity tracking module. The proposed framework applies deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to an extensive training dataset. The latter consists of five activity classes from 12 individuals using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN). An extensive training dataset is used consisting of five activity classes from a group of 12 individuals. The designed android application (runs in the background) collects data from the smartphone's embedded sensors fused with the Google Fit API to validate the results proposed framework.

This study proposes an innovative trip-level inference approach for quantifying the economic benefits of FFBS, leveraging massive FFBS transaction data, the emerging multimodal routing Application Programming Interface from online navigators and travel choice modeling. The proposed approach is able to analyze the economic benefit for every single bike-sharing trip and investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the economic benefits from FFBS. An empirical analysis in Shanghai is conducted using the proposed approach. The estimated saved travel time, cost, and economic benefit due to using FFBS per trip are estimated to be 9.95 min, 3.64 CNY, and 8.68 CNY-eq, respectively. The annual saved travel time, cost, and economic benefits from FFBS in Shanghai are estimated to be 17.665 billion min, 6.463 billion CNY, and 15.410 billion CNY-eq, respectively. The relationships between economic benefits from FFBS and built environment factors in different urban contexts are quantitatively examined using Multiple Linear Regression to explain the spatial heterogeneity in the economic benefits of FFBS. The outcomes provide a useful tool for evaluating the benefits of shared mobility systems, insights into the users’ economic benefit from using FFBS from per-trip, aggregated and spatial perspective, as well as its influencing factors.

In practice, a cloud storage user often desires the advantages of both - efficient filesystem operations with a low unit storage price. An intuitive approach to achieving this goal is to combine the two types of services, e.g., by hosting large files in S3 and small files together with directory structures in EFS. Unfortunately, our benchmark experiments indicate that the clients' download performance for large files becomes a severe system bottleneck. In this article, we attempt to address the bottleneck with little overhead by carefully tweaking the usages of S3 and EFS. Guided by two key observations, we design and implement an open-source system called HyCloud.

In this paper, we mainly study the time division MIMO radar signal processing flow, propose an improved MIMO radar signal processing algorithm, raising the MIMO radar algorithm processing speed combined with the previous algorithms, and, on this basis, a parallel simulation system for the MIMO radar based on the CPU/GPU architecture is proposed. The outer layer of the framework is coarse-grained with OpenMP for acceleration on the CPU, and the inner layer of fine-grained data processing is accelerated on the GPU. Its performance is significantly faster than the serial computing equipment, and satisfactory acceleration effects have been achieved in the CPU/GPU architecture simulation. The experimental results show that the MIMO radar parallel simulation system with CPU/GPU architecture greatly improves the computing power of the CPU-based method. Compared with the serial sequential CPU method, GPU simulation achieves a speedup of 130 times.

Although many studies have investigated the usage demand of bike-sharing systems in an area, research investigating the distance decay patterns of using dockless bike-sharing systems (DLBS) from a spatially heterogeneous perspective based on large-scale datasets is lacking. This study firstly utilizes massive transaction record data from DLBS in Shanghai of China and online map navigator Application Programming Interface to empirically estimate the distance decay patterns of using DLBS and reveal the spatial heterogeneity in distance decay of using DLBS across different urban contexts. Afterward, this study examines the mechanism of spatial heterogeneity in distance decay, leveraging multiple data resources including Point of Interest (POI) data, demographic data, and road network data. The associations among the distance decay of using DLBS with built environment factors are investigated by multiple linear regression. Results indicate that factors such as population density, land use entropy, branch road density, and metro station density are significantly related to larger distance decay of using DLBS, while factors such as commercial land use ratio, industrial land use ratio, and motorway density are significantly linked to smaller distance decay in Shanghai. Lastly, we further employ an adaptative geographically weighted regression to investigate the spatial divergences of the influences of built environment factors on distance decay. Results reveal notably distinct and even inverse influences of a built environment factor on the distance decay of using DLBS in different urban contexts. The findings provide insights into the distance decay patterns of using DLBS in different urban contexts and their interactions with the built environment, which can support accurate planning and management of sustainable DLBS as per specific urban characteristics. © 2021 The Author(s)","China; Shanghai; Application programming interfaces (API); Land use; Large dataset; Linear regression; Population statistics; Subway stations; Built environment; Decay patterns; Distance decay; Environment factors; Large-scale analysis; Shared micro-mobility system; Sharing systems; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial interaction; Urban context; cycle transport; heterogeneity; land use planning; mobility; spatial analysis; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation system; travel demand; Bicycles","Built environment; Distance decay; Shared micro-mobility system; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial interactions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103691750"

Software defined network (SDN) provides centralized network management through the control plane. In this article, a mechanism for the privacy enhancement of the Domain Name System (DNS) is proposed using intent-based MTD over SDN. DNS is a critical internet service with a high risk of privacy disclosure as it is related to user preferences. The proposed model privacy enhancement using intent-based MTD running over SDN (PEIMS) exploits IBN API of ONOS SDN controller along with Openflow flow modification for privacy enhancement. PEIMS core components include MTD application running over the ONOS SDN controller, ONOS intent-based API, and the DNS server. The notion is the protection of privacy disclosures that occur during DNS queries. PEIMS provides a dynamic port shuffling technique for mapping DNS traffic to minimize the attacker's chances of observing the DNS queries responses. The proposed model was implemented using ONOS controller, ONOS north bound intent-based API, and Mininet. The proposed model was evaluated in terms of privacy protection, attacker, and defender cost. The results showed promising trends for DNS privacy protection at a low computational cost.

The most obvious difference of Jaya algorithm from other algorithms is that it does not need any control parameters for updating. However, Jaya algorithm is able to successfully reach the optimum solutions without any delay. In this study, in order to test the robustness and practicality of this novel algorithm technique, different steel space frame problems that have been studied with other algorithms in literature are examined. The minimum weight designs of the problems are carried out by selecting suitable C-section from a prepared list including 85 C-sections with lips taken from American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI 2008). A program is coded in MATLAB interacting with SAP2000 OAPI (Open Application Programming Interface) in order to obtain optimum solutions. The strength constraints according to AISI-LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design), lateral displacement constraints, inter-story drift constraints and geometrical constraints are taken into account in the analyses. Two different cold-formed steel space frames are taken from literature to research optimum solutions by using Jaya algorithm. The first steel space frame is 379-member and the second steel space frame is 1211-member. The results obtained using Jaya algorithm are compared with those in reference studies. The results prove that Jaya algorithm technique is quite successful and practical optimum design of cold-formed steel space frames.

To address this issue, free viewpoint images can greatly benefit the operators in terms of collision avoidance as the operators are able to view the robot’s surrounding from the images at arbitrary points, giving them a better depth information. In this paper, a novel free viewpoint image generation system is proposed. One approach to generate free viewpoint images is to use multiple cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Instead of using the expensive LiDAR, this study utilizes a cost-effective laser rangefinder (LRF) and a characteristic of man-made environments. In other words, we install multiple fisheye cameras and an LRF on a robot. Free viewpoint images are generated under the assumption that walls are perpendicular to the floor. Furthermore, an easy calibration for estimating the poses of the multiple fisheye cameras, the LRF, and the robot model is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate free viewpoint images using cameras and an LRF. Finally, the proposed method is primarily implemented using OpenGL Shading Language to utilize a graphics processing unit computation to achieve a real-time processing of the multiple high-resolution images.

Raytracing and radiosity rendering techniques are achieving more and more close to reality results thanks to these improvements. Many manufacturing industries are taking advantage of these technologies, like footwear industry, where 3D CAD shoe models are been rendering in real time with a huge qualitative leap in terms of efficiency, costs and close-to-reality visualization results. All the same, the performance of the computational models used for the representation of virtual materials, texture maps (like normal or roughness map), specular and diffuse reflection models, illumination or shadows among many other elements, is leading to having different visualization results depending on the 3D engine that it is been used, even though we work with the same CAD model together with its materials and representation scene. Furthermore, if we bring all these implementations to web technologies, like WebGL, we must tackle not only the visualization problem but also, data optimization and computational capacity issues due to the fact of the web browsers and Internet nature. This paper proposes a computational model for hyper-realistic representation in 3D engines that offers correct results for both, 3D engines optimized for computers and 3D engines for web environments.

Message-passing interface (MPI) is used to exploit process parallelisms for subdomains, frequencies, and solving equations. Thread parallelisms for merge sorting, element analysis, matrix assembly, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions are developed by Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). We validate the algorithm through several model simulations and study the effects of topography and conductivity anisotropy on apparent resistivities and phase responses. Scalability tests are performed on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer to analyze the parallel performance of different parallel granularities.

In IoT based smart cities, the smart objects (devices) are connected with each other via internet as a backbone. The sensed data by the smart objects are transmitted to the sink for further processing using multi hop communication. The smart cities use the analyzed data to improve their infrastructure, public utilities and they enhance their services by using the IoT technology for the betterment of livelihood of the common people. For IoT based smart cities, waste collection is a prominent issue for municipalities that aim to achieve a clean environment. With a boom in population in urban areas, an increasing amount of waste is generated. A major issue of waste management system is the poor process used in waste collection and segregation. Public bins begin to overflow for a long period before the process of cleaning starts, which is resulting in an accumulation of bacteria causing bad odors and spreading of diseases. In order to overcome this issue, in this paper an IoT based smart predication and monitoring of waste disposal system is proposed which utilizes off-the-shelf components that can be mounted to a bin of any size and measure fill levels. An Arduino microcontroller is employed in the proposed model to interface the infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), weight sensors, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) module is used to monitor the status of bins at predetermined intervals. The proposed system transmits the data using the cluster network to the master module which is connected to the backend via Wi-Fi. As data is collected, an intelligent neural network algorithm namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used which will intelligently learn and predict the upcoming wastage from waste generation patterns. Moreover, the proposed system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to notify the appropriate people when the bins were full and needed to be emptied. The Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) is used to send notification messages in web apps in browsers that provide service work support. Hence, the proposed system is useful to the society by providing facilities to the governments for enforcing stricter regulations for waste disposal. Additional features such as automated calibration of bin height, a dynamic web data dashboard as well as collation of data into a distributed real-time firebase database are also provided in the proposed system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bins; Distributed database systems; Global positioning system; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Public utilities; Smart city; Waste disposal; Wi-Fi; Automated calibration; Clean environment; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi hop communication; Neural network algorithm; Off-the-shelf components; Waste disposal systems; Waste management systems; Internet of things","IoT; LSTM; Recurrent neural network; Sensors; Smart cities; Waste management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112807675"

With the development of the economy and the progress of the times, the equalization of public infrastructure has become an important concern. The accessibility and fairness of transportation have become a hot topic of research in various fields. To promote transport equity and formulate more reasonable transport planning and policies, this paper takes the Kunshan city as the research object, based on the mobile phone signaling data and the travel time consumption data from the application programming interface (API) of Gaode Map, using weighted average accessibility and the Theil index to investigate the accessibility and equity of public transport and car traffic in the Kunshan city. The study found that the accessibility of public transport is lower than that of car transport in the same research unit, but the equity of public transport is better than that of car transport, that is, the public transport is fair and the efficiency is neglected. In the same mode of transportation, equity presents a high four-week low distribution in the central urban area, and the spatial equity difference is mainly caused by the difference in accessibility levels between cell units. According to the research conclusions, it is recommended that Kunshan further optimize the spatial layout of public transportation infrastructure and adopt measures such as bus speed increase to achieve equity and efficiency and improve the competitiveness of public transportation. © 2021 Fei Shi.","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Traffic control; Travel time; Urban transportation; Equalisation; Hot topics; Multi-Sources; Public infrastructures; Public transport; Public transportation; Research object; Transport planning; Transport policy; Urban transport; Efficiency","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119920791"

Parallel computing is a good approach for improving the numerical computing speed. This paper reports the advances in parallel computing of the wheel–rail contact simulations. The proposed method uses OpenMP to parallelise the multiple contact points of all the wheel–rail interfaces of a locomotive model. The method has been implemented in the vehicle system dynamics simulation package GENSYS. Simulations were conducted using two numerical solvers (4th Runge-Kutta and HeunC) and a maximum of four computer cores. Simulation cases have shown exactly the same numerical results using serial computing and parallel computing, which prove the effectiveness of the parallel computing method. The HeunC solver achieved the same simulation results and is 3.5 times faster than the 4th Runge-Kutta method. Simulation results obtained from both numerical solvers show that parallel computing using 2, 3 and 4 computer cores can improve the simulation speeds by roughly 29, 39 and 41%, respectively. There is an apparent diminishing of the rate of improvement due to the increase of the communication resource overhead when more computer cores are used. Using up to four computer cores does not require revision of the GENSYS code, and simulations can be executed using personal computers. © IMechE 2019.","Application programming interfaces (API); Numerical methods; Parallel processing systems; Personal computers; System theory; Vehicle wheels; Communication resources; GENSYS; OpenMP; Parallel com- puting; Rail contact; Time-consuming tasks; Vehicle system dynamics; Wheel-rail contacts; Runge Kutta methods","GENSYS; OpenMP; parallel computing; vehicle system dynamics; Wheel–rail contact","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074498064"

It was observed that the modified DSA model is more efficient with the increase of the optical thickness, where the acceleration ratio is improved to 6 for the optical thicker media. In addition, similar acceleration effect was witnessed for both scattering dominated and non-scattering dominated media. Furthermore, by employing the modified DSA model into the reconstruction, it is interesting to remark that not only the reconstruction time is significantly reduced with the acceleration ratio of 8-11, but also the reconstructed image is further improved.

The numerical method is developed through applying the fundamental solution of layered elastic solids and integrating numerically it over the loading area. The adaptive integration of the displacement and traction integrals over the loading area is designed to calculate the nearly singular integral for the source point close to an element. The discretization approach is applied to deal with an arbitrarily depth-heterogeneous elastic solid. OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the internal loop, which controls element iterations so that a high computing speed can be obtained. For an axisymmetric internal loading problem, the displacements obtained with the present formulation are in a very good agreement with existing closed-form solutions. Finally, stresses and displacements in non-homogeneous halfspaces induced by horizontally and vertically uniform rectangular loadings are presented.

When adapting client code to non-backwards compatible changes in libraries, a major challenge is how to locate affected API uses in client code, which is currently a difficult manual task. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a simple pattern language for expressing API access points and a pattern-matching tool based on lightweight static analysis. Experimental evaluation on 15 popular npm packages shows that typical breaking changes are easy to express as patterns. Running the static analysis on 265 clients of these packages shows that it is accurate and efficient: it reveals usages of breaking APIs with only 14% false positives and no false negatives, and takes less than a second per client on average. In addition, the analysis is able to report its confidence, which makes it easier to identify the false positives. These results suggest that the approach, despite its simplicity, can reduce the manual effort of the client developers. © 2020 Owner/Author.","High level languages; Libraries; Pattern matching; Static analysis; Access points; Client code; Experimental evaluation; False negatives; False positive; Javascript; JavaScript programs; Pattern languages; Application programming interfaces (API)","breaking changes; software evolution; software maintenance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097578586"

Crypto-ransomware is a type of ransomware that blocks access to its victim's files by the use of an encryption algorithm. This encrypted file remains permanently blocked, even if the victim is able to remove the ransomware from the infected file. This has forced victims to pay the ransom demanded in exchange for a decryption key, although the decryption key provided is not guaranteed to work. To address this situation, we propose a pre-encryption detection algorithm (PEDA) for detecting crypto-ransomware prior to the occurrence of any encryption. The PEDA has two levels of detection. The first is a signature repository (SR) that identifies any matches of the signature with that of known ransomware. The second detection level uses a learning algorithm (LA) that can detect both known and unknown crypto-ransomware. LA uses a machine learning approach to train the predictive model using data from the application program interface (API). In order to understand PEDA functionality, LA is being evaluated using conventional metrics and unconventional metrics. Conventional metrics such as the true positive rate, accuracy, and precision can provide important performance indicator, but not comprehensive enough to assess the LA capability. Six new metrics had been proposed to provide greater insight. Based on the results, it can be concluded that LA had achieved its objective of detecting crypto-ransomware before the encryption is viable and that its performance is robust with a high net benefit. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer viruses; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Turing machines; Application program interfaces; Encryption algorithms; Encryption detections; Levels of detections; Machine learning approaches; Performance indicators; Predictive modeling; True positive rates; Cryptography","Crypto; Detection; Encryption; Evaluation; Machine learning; Metric; Ransomware","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093956658"

This article presents an optimization method for selection of BFTIs from the image flows acquired by five oblique cameras onboard UAV. The proposed method uses multiobjective functions, which consists of the smallest occlusion of the BFTI and the largest façade texture area, to select the optimal BFTIs. Geometric correction, color equalization, and texture repairment are also considered for correction of BFTI's distortions, uneven color, and occlusion by other objects such as trees. Visual C++ and OpenGL under the Windows Operating System are used to implement the proposed methods and algorithms. The proposed method is verified using 49 800 oblique images collected by five cameras onboard the Matrice 600 Pro (M600 Pro) UAV system over Dongguan Street, in the City of Ji'nan, Shandong, China. To restore the partially occluded textures, different thresholds and different sizes of windows are experimented, and a template window of $200\times200$ pixels2 is recommended. With the proposed method, 2740 BFTIs are extracted from 49 800 oblique images. As compared with the Pix4Dmapper and Smart 3-D method, it can be concluded that the optimal texture can be selected from the image flow acquired by multiple cameras onboard UAV and the approximately 95% memory occupied by the original BFTIs is reduced. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","China; Dongguan; Guangdong; Shandong; Antennas; Application programming interfaces (API); C++ (programming language); Cameras; Image acquisition; Textures; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Windows operating system; Building facades; Different sizes; Geometric correction; Multi-objective functions; Multiple cameras; Optimization method; Photo-realistic; Threedimensional (3-d); digital photogrammetry; geometry; image analysis; optimization; pixel; software; three-dimensional modeling; unmanned vehicle; Image texture","Facades; image flow; oblique photogrammetry; optimal algorithm; texture; texture mapping; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099786126"

Managing knowledge in the IWs domain is complex; however, promoting knowledge sharing based on standards and common terms agreeable to all players is essential and is something that must be established. In this context, ontologies, as a conceptual tool and a key component of knowledge-based systems, have been used by organizations for effective knowledge management, better decision-making, and interoperability among diverse institutions of an IWs domain. The development of ontology involves structural and logical complexity, and requires a well-designed, mature, and widely accepted methodology, to ensure its reliability. Many methodologies for ontology development have been proposed by several researchers; however, most of the developed methodologies have not included several important phases. Furthermore, several methodologies have not provided the complete details of the techniques and activities involved in the ontology construction process. Fewer details make it difficult to follow a methodology for designing ontologies. This study aims to compare existing methodologies based on sixteen important criteria and proposes an improved methodology for ontology development for IWs domains. The proposed methodology has included several important phases such as the Estimation of Human Resources, Re-engineering and Reusing of Resources, Collaborative Ontology Construction, the Conceptualization of both Endurants and Perdurants, Localization of an Ontology, Ontology Integration and Merging, Support for Interoperability, Versioning of an Ontology, and Ontology Population. The proposed methodology has been applied to design an OntoWM domain ontology for the Waste Management (WM) domain. The evaluation of the proposed methodology has been made by utilizing the designed OntoWM domain ontology in an ontology-based web application called SmartBinAnalytics. SmartBinAnalytics has been built using OntoWM, Java Server Pages (JSP), Jena Application Programming Interface (API), and MySQL. The proposed methodology can be used for the construction of domain ontologies in any IWs domain.

One of the most critical road monitoring and maintenance activities is the detection of road anomalies such as potholes. Identification of potholes is necessary to avoid road accidents, prevent damage of vehicles, enhance travelling comforts, etc. Although maintenance of roads is considered to be a serious issue by the authorities over the years, lack of proper detection and mapping of road potholes makes the issue more severe. To overcome this problem, an end-to-end system called PotSpot is built for real-time detection, monitoring, and spatial mapping of potholes across the city A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed and evaluated on real-world dataset for pothole detection. Additionally, real-time pothole-marked maps are generated with the help of Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface). To provide an end-to-end service through this system, both the pothole detection and pothole mapping are integrated through an android application. The proposed model is also compared with six baselines namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and three pre-trained CNN models InceptionV3, VGG19 and VGG16 in terms of performance metrics to verify its effectiveness. The proposed model achieves better accuracy (≈ 97.6 %) as compared to the above-mentioned baseline methods.

The plate can oscillate in horizontal and vertical directions. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the unsteady turbulent flow field. The governing equations are solved numerically applying a finite-volume approach. OpenMP Parallel SIMPLE algorithm is employed with power-low scheme for the convective terms. Also, the turbulent flow properties are estimated by a two-layer zonal model based on k−εmodel and Wolfstein near wall treatment. Dimensionless effective parameters including Reynolds number (Re), Grashof number (Gr) and vibration angular frequency (ω) are varied to investigate inherent flow structures and the heat transfer rate. It was deduced from the results that at high Gr and low Re numbers, the effect of internal plate vibrations is negligible and the fluid flow is induced only by the buoyancy force. As Re and ω are increased, the effect of internal plate vibration becomes dominant. At high Re and ω values while Gr kept low, benchmark cavity heat transfer is increased up to 90 and 80 times due to the vibration of internal horizontal and vertical plates, respectively. The obtained results can be beneficial for the dryers of glass recycling industries in order to heat and smash the glass particles without a significant heat loss. Desired condition occurs at high Gr and ω when the flow Re number is comparatively low. © 2020","Application programming interfaces (API); Dryers (equipment); Glass; Glass industry; Heat convection; Plates (structural components); Recycling; Reynolds number; Thermoacoustics; Turbulent flow; Vibrations (mechanical); Wall function; Angular frequencies; Effective parameters; Finite volume approach; Rate of heat transfer; Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations; Transverse vibrations; Two layer zonal model; Unsteady turbulent flows; Navier Stokes equations","Glass recycling dryer; Mixed convection; Numerical study; Square cavity; Vibrating isolated plate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084606264"

Effects of these phenomena on flow stress can be expressed through various semi-empirical models. To find unknown parameters of these semi-empirical models, one can use a process such as system identification in the way that the difference between experimental data and model output become minimized. Genetic algorithm is one of reliable and flexible methods in this category that has gained extensive application in different fields of science; so, in this research, Genetic algorithm was used to model flow stress of API-X70 microalloyed steel considering mentioned metallurgical phenomena during hot compression test.

This results in the need for different domain experts to design special system development schemes for different kinds of mechanical products, which greatly increases the cost of the research and development. In addition, there have been difficulties in the automation, intellectualization and acceleration of mechanical product design process, as the process is based on experiential knowledge and relies extensively on the synthetic decision of experts (SDE), which is hard to be integrated into the design process without the participation of experts in person. To cope with these two issues, a knowledge-based automated design (KAD) system for mechanical products was developed in this study. Firstly, a general feature design flow (GFDF) framework was proposed to represent the design knowledge of various mechanical products from initial design stage, including requirement analysis, to the final automated generation of computer-aided design (CAD) model. Based on parametric technology and application programming interface (API) functions, the GFDF framework decomposes the explicit and implicit knowledge of a top-down design process into four rank-correlated features and two feature correlation matrices (FCMs) respectively. Based on the GFDF framework, a requirement analysis method using analysis hierarchy process (AHP) was proposed to transfer qualitative features to quantitative parameters. Secondly, by adopting the support vector regression (SVR) machine, a feature reuse case adaptation (FR-CA) method based on case-based reasoning (CBR) was proposed to achieve the automation and intellectualization of parameter solving integrating the SDE without the actual participation of experts. The FRCA method transforms the SDE into an FCM, which can be identified during the case adaptation process, and maximizes the utilization of solved features in each adaptation process. A comparison experiment between FR-CA and conventional method for case adaptation indicated that the adaptation performance of FR-CA method is better than that of the conventional one. Finally, the KAD system was applied to the design of corn huskers. The result showed that the KAD system could improve the automated, intelligent and rapid design of mechanical products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Case based reasoning; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Computer programming; Knowledge based systems; Machinery; Product design; Automated design; Automated design system; Case adaptation; Design-process; Experiential knowledge; Feature design flow framework; Features design; Intelligent designs; Knowledge based; Mechanical product; Automation","Automated design; Case adaptation; Experiential knowledge; Feature design flow framework; Intelligent design; Mechanical products","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104299405"

A wireless monitoring device based on a nine-axis microinertial sensor is designed for the characteristics of swimming motion, and measurement experiments are conducted for different intensities and stances of swimming motion. By comparing and analyzing the motion characteristics of various swimming stances, the basis for performing stroke identification is proposed, and the monitoring data characteristics of the experimental results match with it. The stance reconstruction technology is studied, PC-based OpenGL multithreaded data synchronization and stance following reconstruction are designed to reconstruct the joint association data of multiple nodes in a constrained set, and the reconstruction results are displayed through graphic image rendering. For the whole system, each key technology is organically integrated to design a wearable wireless sensing network-based pose resolution analysis and reconstruction recognition system. Inertial sensors inevitably suffer from drift after a long period of position trajectory tracking. The proposed fusion algorithm corrects the drift of position estimation using the measurement of the visual sensor, and the measurement of the inertial sensor complements the missing measurement of the visual sensor for the case of occlusion of the visual sensor and fast movement of the upper limb. An experimental platform for upper-limb position estimation based on the fusion of inertial and visual sensors is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Many solutions have been proposed for detecting malware variants. However, accurate detection is challenging due to the constantly evolving nature of the malware variants that cause concept drift. Existing malware detection solutions assume that the mapping learned from historical malware features will be valid for new and future malware. The relationship between input features and the class label has been considered stationary, which doesn't hold for the ever-evolving nature of malware variants. Malware features change dynamically due to code obfuscations, mutations, and the modification made by malware authors to change the features' distribution and thus evade the detection rendering the detection model obsolete and ineffective. This study presents an Adaptive behavioral-based Incremental Batch Learning Malware Variants Detection model using concept drift detection and sequential deep learning (AIBL-MVD) to accommodate the new malware variants. Malware behaviors were extracted using dynamic analysis by running the malware files in a sandbox environment and collecting their Application Programming Interface (API) traces. According to the malware first-time appearance, the malware samples were sorted to capture the malware variants' change characteristics. The base classifier was then trained based on a subset of historical malware samples using a sequential deep learning model. The new malware samples were mixed with a subset of old data and gradually introduced to the learning model in an adaptive batch size incremental learning manner to address the catastrophic forgetting dilemma of incremental learning. The statistical process control technique has been used to detect the concept drift as an indication for incrementally updating the model as well as reducing the frequency of model updates. Results from extensive experiments show that the proposed model is superior in terms of detection rate and efficiency compared with the static model, periodic retraining approaches, and the fixed batch size incremental learning approach. The model maintains an average of 99.41% detection accuracy of new and variants malware with a low updating frequency of 1.35 times per month. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Statistical process control; Base classifiers; Catastrophic forgetting; Detection accuracy; Incremental batch learning; Incremental learning; Incrementally Updating; Malware behaviors; Malware detection; Malware","adaptive incremental batch learning; concept drift detection; deep learning; Malware variant detection; statistical process control","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110746386"

In the current days, column-wise compressed storages are mounted to the big data servers due to its space efficiency and flash drive has become an important storage in building internet data center due to its superior performance and power-economic nature. We will introduce a short overview on sensor networks and will propose a new storage management scheme for sensor databases. The core idea of our scheme is based on a new RAID5 storage model using column-wise segmentation and compression to improve space efficiency without sacrificing input/output (I/O) performance. In addition, we developed a simulation system using CSim application program interface (API). Finally, we show that proposed storage control scheme outperforms the original RAID5 scheme by performance evaluation. The proposed scheme could be used in various industrial applications such as smart factory and self-drive car databases which handle massive amounts of 1 PB data from internet of things sensors.

The libraries evolve to accommodate new features or mitigate security vulnerabilities, thereby breaking the Application Programming Interface(API) used by the software. Such breaking changes in the libraries may discourage client code from using the new library versions thereby keeping the application vulnerable and not up-to-date. We propose a novel output-oriented program synthesis algorithm to automate API usage adaptations via program transformation. Our aim is not only to rely on the few example human adaptations of the clients from the old library version to the new library version, since this can lead to over-fitting transformation rules. Instead, we also rely on example usages of the new updated library in clients, which provide valuable context for synthesizing and applying the transformation rules. Our tool APIFix provides an automated mechanism to transform application code using the old library versions to code using the new library versions - thereby achieving automated API usage adaptation to fix the effect of breaking changes. Our evaluation shows that the transformation rules inferred by APIFix achieve 98.7% precision and 91.5% recall. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art program synthesis approaches, we show that our approach significantly reduces over-fitting while synthesizing transformation rules for API usage adaptations.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Application programming interface usage adaptation; Applications programming interfaces; Breaking change; Breakings; Overfitting; Program synthesis; Program transformations; Programming by Example; Third parties; Transformation rules; Libraries","API usage adaptation; Breaking changes; Program synthesis; Program transformation; Programming by example","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117578836"

Open CNC aims to deal with the vendor-proprietary issue and numerous open CNC prototypes have been developed in the past three decades. But they are heterogeneous, low-flexible, and remain working in a stand-alone pattern. In today's Internet era, the stand-alone working pattern tends to evolve into cloud-based control pattern (cloud-CNC).

This paper aims to develop the INC application within the constraints of open CNC and cloud-CNC. Service-oriented paradigm is utilised to develop INC application at three levels. First, INC application is a software-as-a-service-style application. Second, CNC modules are exposed as services and CNC functionality is determined by service-oriented architecture. Third, INC application is developed using microservices architecture. Four autonomous INC microservices are defined and their mapping relationships are determined.

It is necessary to filter the collected image. With the increasing amount of image data, the traditional single-processor or multiprocessor computing equipment has been unable to meet the requirements of real-time data processing. In this paper, the computational model of weighted mean filtering and the characteristics of high performance computer architecture are studied. An efficient hierarchical image weighted mean filtering parallel algorithm for Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is designed and implemented, which can fully express the parallelism of the computing model. The parallel algorithm takes full account of the characteristics of image discrete convolution computing and the multi-layer logic architecture of high performance computer, deeply excavates the parallelism of the computing platform and computing model, and realizes the efficient task mapping from computing model to computing resources.

Harnessing the performance that these accelerators provide requires the use of specialized native programming interfaces, such as CUDA or OpenCL, or higher-level programming models like OpenMP or OpenACC. However, on managed programming languages, offloading execution into GPUs is much harder and error-prone, mainly due to the need to call through a native API (Application Programming Interface), and because of mismatches between value and reference semantics. The Fancier framework provides a unified interface to Java, C/C++, and OpenCL C compute kernels, together with facilities to smooth the transitions between these programming languages. This combination of features makes GPU acceleration on Java much more approachable. In addition, Fancier Java code can be directly translated into equivalent C/C++ or OpenCL C code easily, which simplifies the implementation of higher-level abstractions targeting GPU or parallel execution on Java.

Therefore, how to improve the detection accuracy of malware programs is a very important problem. This paper proposes a deep learning malware program detection algorithm based on attention mechanism. Word2Vec model is used to map the Application programming interface (API) into word vectors, and all word vectors of each sample are arranged into a matrix with the same size. On this basis, residual network is used to extract features of samples. The features are input into the attention mechanism to learn the similarity between samples. Then, the features are weighted with the similarity to obtain the new features with better robustness. The new features and the original features are added element by element to obtain the sample features more suitable for classification. Finally, samples are classified by classifier. Experiments show that the classification effect of the proposed method is better than that of the traditional machine learning method. © 2020 Chinese Institute of Electronics.","Application programming interfaces (API); Classification (of information); Deep learning; Learning systems; Signal detection; Attention mechanisms; Detection algorithm; Malware detection; Malware program; Malwares; Network structures; Residual network structure; Self-attention mechanism; Word vectors; Word2vec; Malware","Malware program; Residual network structure; Self-attention mechanism; Word2Vec","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101616241"

Over the past few years, a multitude of methods, algorithms, and software have emerged to support the design and representation of such structures. An interoperable solution to connect and compose ad hoc approaches, therefore, could create the network effect to further the advancement of the field. In this paper, we proposed an Application Programming Interface (API) for multiscale structure modeling, which employs a query-based approach to provide interoperability between different shape and material property representations across different scales. The concept of neighborhood is used to link the adjacent scales such that the effective material property of the structure within a neighborhood on the fine-scale equals the material property on the coarse-scale. The use of intrinsic effective material properties enables the interchangeability between different families of fine-scale structures that support a common set of effective properties. The interoperability with downstream applications such as visualization and manufacturing planning is guaranteed through multiscale queries that extend but remains compatible with single scale queries. Such capability is demonstrated through a novel multiscale ray-marching algorithm. We discuss several usage scenarios and provide exemplary implementations of the core interfaces and functionalities of the proposed multiscale API. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Interfaces (materials); Interoperability; Manufacture; Structural properties; Downstream applications; Effective material property; Effective property; Fine-scale structures; Manufacturing planning; Manufacturing technologies; Mechanical design; Multi-scale structures; Application programming interfaces (API)","Architected materials; Homogenization; Multiscale queries; Multiscale structure modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113344235"

The computer code is designed to get most of the inputs from the building model in SAP2000, to have minimal manual inputs that define diagrid shell geometry. The code is also built so that the engineer evaluates the optimum diagrid geometry for any rectangular plan building, which is modeled in SAP2000 software. Three different buildings, which consist of 30, 60, and 90 stories, are modeled in SAP2000 without diagrid shells on facades. Based on these models, the diagrid shell geometries are analyzed for both uniform angle (UA) and varying angle (VA) geometries. A different geometry approach to VA models is proposed, consisting of symmetry and continuum for the load distribution and asymmetry, achieving minimal weight. In order to evaluate the optimum VA topology, GA, is used. Predetermined dead, live, and wind loads are applied to the models based on minimum design loads according to American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7-10, with corresponding load factors to be able to get more realistic results. Based on the resultant module diagonal cross-sectional areas, an algorithm is developed and encoded in order to determine minimum required pipe section sizes according to buckling design of compression members as stated in American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 360-10, to give the engineer an approximate idea of what the required sections should be. Additionally, the feasibility of the optimum models is compared by complexity index parameters. The results of the analyses show that optimum VA models are more efficient than UA models concerning the diagrid shell's total weight. However, UA models are more feasible, according to complexity index values. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Design; Engineers; Geometry; MATLAB; Shells (structures); Topology; American institute of steel constructions; American Society of Civil Engineers; Cross sectional area; Genetic-algorithm optimizations; Load distributions; Material utilization; Open application programming interface; Strength and stiffness; Genetic algorithms","diagrid structures; genetic algorithm; high-rise buildings; size optimization; steel structure; topology optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102787254"

These costs can be reduced by a condition-orientated maintenance approach. A condition-oriented maintenance strategy optimizes maintenance tasks by executing them with varying levels of detail and focus depending on the system and life cycle phase. OEMs evaluate operating data and structured data from the maintenance history for this purpose, but SMEs lack the capacity for this evaluation. In particular, the unstructured descriptive comments in the maintenance reports generated by service technicians remain unused. In this work, we propose a framework to incorporate this information from the maintenance reports along with the status records from the SCADA system. For this purpose, a mechanism has to be developed to make the contents of the service reports machine-evaluable. The mechanism used in this approach is an ontology, which enables the codification of implicit knowledge such as the experience knowledge of the service technicians. The ontology’s purpose is to link status codes of onshore WT with historical maintenance reports and thereby enabling an automated evaluation. Using an API (application programming interface), the ontology can be integrated into an algorithm to analyse status data and maintenance documents. In this manner, recommendations for actions can be derived and maintenance tasks can be optimized. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cost reduction; Life cycle; Ontology; SCADA systems; Wind turbines; Automated evaluation; Electricity generation cost; Implicit knowledge; Maintenance approaches; Maintenance cost; Maintenance strategies; Maintenance tasks; Onshore wind turbine; Maintenance","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103357368"

Robots gather the information from which emotion detection is processed via different media, such as text, speech, images, or videos. The multimedia content is then properly processed to recognize emotions/sentiments, for example, by analyzing faces and postures in images/videos based on machine learning techniques or by converting speech into text to perform emotion detection with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Keeping this information in semantic repositories offers a wide range of possibilities for implementing smart applications. We propose a framework to allow social robots to detect emotions and to store this information in a semantic repository, based on EMONTO (an EMotion ONTOlogy), and in the first figure or table caption. Please define if appropriate. an ontology to represent emotions. As a proof-of-concept, we develop a first version of this framework focused on emotion detection in text, which can be obtained directly as text or by converting speech to text. We tested the implementation with a case study of tour-guide robots for museums that rely on a speech-to-text converter based on the Google Application Programming Interface (API) and a Python library, a neural network to label the emotions in texts based on NLP transformers, and EMONTO integrated with an ontology for museums; thus, it is possible to register the emotions that artworks produce in visitors.

This was usually driven by a market demand for highly available solutions with differentiating features running at line rate, even at the expense of flexibility and tightly-coupled monolithic designs. Today, however, the market advantage is achieved by providing more features in shorter development cycles and quickly deploying them in different operating environments. In fact, network operators are increasingly adopting continuous software delivery practices as well as new architectural styles (e.g., microservices) to decouple functionality and accelerate development. A key challenge in revisiting NF design is state management, which is usually highly optimized for a deployment by carefully selecting the underlying data store. Therefore, migrating to a data store that suits a different use case is time-consuming as it requires code refactoring and adaptation to new application programming interfaces, APIs. As a result, refactoring NF software for different environments can take up to months, reducing the pace at which new features and upgrades can be deployed in production networks. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that it is feasible to introduce an abstraction layer to decouple NF state management from the data store adopted while still approaching line-rate performance. We present FlexState, a state management system that exposes data store functionality as configuration options, which reduces code refactoring efforts. Experiments show that FlexState achieves significant flexibility in optimizing the state management, and accelerates deployment on new scenarios while preserving performance and scalability.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Commerce; Network management; Transfer functions; Architectural style; Code re-factoring; Configuration options; Market advantages; Operating environment; Packet processing; Performance and scalabilities; Production network; Information management","Data storage systems; middleboxes; network functions; network functions virtualization; NFV; parallel processing; state management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101739311"

The validations of accuracy and efficiency show that this method can solve 3-D seismic response of a large-scale hill topography for broadband waves, and overcome the weakness of large storage and low efficiency of the traditional IBEM. Based on this new algorithm architecture, taking the broadband scattering of plane SV waves by a large-scale Gaussian-shaped hill of thousands-meters height as an example, the influence of several important parameters is investigated, including the incident frequency, the incident angle and the height-width and length-width ratio of the hill. The numerical results illustrate that the amplification effect on the ground motion by a near-hemispherical hill is more significant than the narrow hill. For low-frequency waves, the scattering effect of the higher hill is more pronounced, and there is only a single peak near the top of the hill. However, for high-frequency waves, rapid spatial variation of displacement amplitude appears on the hill surface. © 2020, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration.","Application programming interfaces (API); Boundary element method; Efficiency; Sailing vessels; Seismic waves; Seismology; Topography; Algorithm architectures; Amplification effects; Displacement amplitudes; High frequency waves; Indirect boundary element method; Length-width ratios; Low-frequency waves; Threedimensional (3-d); Three dimensional computer graphics","3-D hill topography; indirect boundary element method (IBEM); parallel calculation; scattering of seismic waves","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092761928"

This study aims to facilitate the computer-assisted coding of the 11th revision of the ICD (ICD-11) by leveraging the data structures of ICD-11 and semantics in WordNet. First, a computer-assisted coding framework using WordNet and ICD-11 application programming interface (API) is proposed. Secondly, a network based on entity relations in ICD-11 and synonym sets in WordNet, called CodeNet, is developed. Thirdly, an algorithm for generating ICD-11 code candidates from CodeNet with two tuning parameters on the basis of the input of disease-related text is illustrated. Finally, the discharge summaries in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database and textual information from ICD-11 entities are used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed coding method achieves a precision of 84% and a recall of 89% relative to a precision of 65% and a recall of 81% achieved with the existing ICD-11 API. The proposed method also outperforms other methods in the literature by reducing a failure rate of up to 8% in ICD-11 coding. The proposed thresholds of similarity and percentage can be applied to tuning the performance of our method to meet different coding needs. In sum, improving the new structures of ICD-11 with the use of semantics in WordNet can help develop more reliable computer-aided coding systems for ICD-11 coders. © 2013 IEEE.","Algorithms; Clinical Coding; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Application programming interfaces (API); Failure analysis; Ontology; Semantics; Coding framework; Computer aided; Computer assisted; Discharge summary; International classification of disease; Medical information; Textual information; Tuning parameter; algorithm; analgesia; Article; artificial intelligence; health care personnel; human; ICD-11; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical model; postoperative pain; semantics; support vector machine; typhoid fever; coding; International Classification of Diseases; medical informatics; natural language processing; procedures; Computer programming","computer-assisted coding; diagnostic information; ICD-11; semantics; WordNet","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077756627"

One problem with such methods is that they tap only a few points on the flat sole under the foot and, therefore, do not account for the total ground reaction force. As a result, body weight tends to be under-estimated. This disadvantage has made it more difficult for pedobarography to be used to monitor many diseases, especially when their symptoms include body weight changes. In this paper, the problem of pedobarographic body weight measurement is addressed using a novel ergonomic shoe-integrated sensor array architecture based on concentrating the applied force via three-layered structures that we call Sandwiched Sensor Force Consolidators (SSFC). A shoe prototype is designed with the proposed sensors and shown to accurately measure body weight with an achievable relative accuracy greater than 99%, even in the presence of motion. The achieved relative accuracy is at least 4X better than the existing state of the art. The SSFC shoe prototype is built using readily available soccer shoes and piezoresistive FlexiForce sensors. To improve the wearability and comfort of the instrumented shoe, a semi-computational sensor design methodology is developed based on an equivalent-area concept that can accurately account for SSFC’s with arbitrary shapes. The search space of the optimal SSFC design is shown to be combinatorial, and a high-performance computing (HPC) framework based on OpenMP parallel programming is proposed to accelerate the design optimization process. An optimal sensor design speedup of up to 22X is shown to be achievable using the HPC implementation. © 2020 by the authors.

In this research, anti-plagiarism software was designed especially for the university and its campuses to identify plagiarized text in students' written assignments and laboratory reports. The proposed framework collected original documents to identify plagiarized text using natural language processing. Our research proposes a method to detect plagiarism by applying the core concept of text, which is semantic associations of words and their syntactic composition. Information on the browser was obtained through Request application programming interface by name Url.AbsoluteUri, and it is stored in a centralized Microsoft database Server. A total of 55,001 data samples were collected from 2015 to 2019. Furthermore, we assimilated data from a university website, specifically from the psau.edu.sa network, and arranged the data into students' categories. Furthermore, we extracted words from source documents and student documents using the WordNet library. On a benchmark dataset consisting of 785 plagiarized text and 4,716 original text data, a significant accuracy of 90.2% was achieved. Therefore, the proposed framework demonstrated better performance than the other available tools. Many students mentioned that working on assignments using the framework was suitable because they were able to work on the assignments in harmony, as per their timeframe and from different network locations. The framework also recommends procedures that can be used to avoid plagiarism. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The high observability and simulation performance of underlying frameworks enable to generate and collect more error/failure-related data, considering complex software stack configurations, in a reasonable time. When dealing with sizeable failure-related data sets obtained from multiple fault campaigns, it is essential to filter out parameters (i.e., features) without a direct relationship with the system soft error analysis. In this regard, this paper proposes the use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, aiming to eliminate non-relevant information as well as identify the correlation between fault injection results and application and platform characteristics. This novel approach provides engineers with appropriate means to investigate new and more efficient fault mitigation techniques. The underlying approach is validated with an extensive data set gathered from more than 1.2 million fault injections, comprising several benchmarks, a Linux OS and parallelization libraries (e.g., MPI and OpenMP), as well as through a realistic automotive case study. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer operating systems; Error analysis; Radiation hardening; Software testing; Fault injection; Machine learning techniques; Multi-core systems; Soft error; Virtual platform; Machine learning","fault injection; machine learning techniques; Multicore systems; soft error; virtual platforms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065874201"

However, a few studies have performed an in-depth exploration of the contributing factors of crashes involving AVs. This study aims to predict the severity of crashes involving AVs and analyze the effects of the different factors on crash severity. Crash data were obtained from the AV-related crash reports presented to the California Department of Motor Vehicles in 2019 and included 75 uninjured and 18 injured accident cases. The points-of-interest (POI) data were collected from Google Map Application Programming Interface (API). Descriptive statistics analysis was applied to examine the features of crashes involving AVs in terms of collision type, crash severity, vehicle movement preceding the collision, and degree of vehicle damage. To compare the classification performance of different classifiers, we use two different classification models: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The result shows that the XGBoost model performs better in identifying the injured crashes involving AVs. Compared with the original XGBoost model, the recall and G-mean of the XGBoost model combining POI data improved by 100% and 11.1%, respectively. The main features that contribute to the severity of crashes include weather, degree of vehicle damage, accident location, and collision type. The results indicate that crash severity significantly increases if the AVs collided at an intersection under extreme weather conditions (e.g., fog and snow). Moreover, an accident resulting in injuries also had a higher probability of occurring in areas where land-use patterns are highly diverse. The knowledge gained from this research could ultimately contribute to assessing and improving the safety performance of the current AVs.  © 2020 Hengrui Chen et al.","Application programming interfaces (API); Land use; Vehicles; Classification and regression tree; Classification models; Classification performance; Department of Motor Vehicles; Descriptive statistics; Extreme weather conditions; Points of Interest(POI); Research and development; Accidents","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097048121"

To clarify the morphological and distributional characteristics of rice roots, 'root box' experiments are conducted to mensurate three dimensional spatial coordinates and morphological parameters of rice roots at different growth stages. Based on these experiments and the morphological parameters, the initial position of the root node and growth direction of branches are determined, a rice root model is constructed with B-spline curves by analyzing the topological structure of rice roots to quantify the biological characteristics of rice roots and summarize the morphological structure and growth characteristics of rice roots and improve the cubic growth function to describe the growth change in rice roots. Meanwhile, the output accuracy of the model is tested. In addition, dynamic simulation of rice root growth characteristics in 3D space is implemented using Visual C++ and the OpenGL standard graphics library. Analysis results indicate that the average simulated fitness of the total root length, surface area and volume is about 94.82%, 93.86%, and 91.96%, respectively.

This fact forced software developers as well as hardware vendors to put an extensive focus on energy consumption. This focus becomes even more crucial in power constrained systems, where the amount of power dedicated to applications is limited. In such systems, finding the optimal balance between execution time and energy consumption has a significant impact on utilizing these systems efficiently. A programming model is an essential layer where optimizations can be applied to find the optimal balance. OpenMP is a standard programming model for intra-node parallelism. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of how to optimize the execution time and energy consumption of an OpenMP application using the OpenMP runtime environment at different power levels. We studied twenty-eight OpenMP parallel regions from five NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) applications. Based on the study, we show that for a given power level, a suitable selection of OpenMP runtime parameters can improve the execution time and energy consumption of a parallel region up to 67% and 72%, respectively. We also show that these fine-grained improvements resulted in up to 26% of execution time and 38% of energy consumption improvement for a given OpenMP application. We finally observed that optimizing the energy consumption behavior alone across all power levels regardless of execution time behavior can lead to an additional energy consumption improvement of up to 55%. However, this improvement comes at the expense of execution time. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Power management; NAS parallel benchmarks; OpenMP; OpenMP applications; Over provisioning; Power-constrained systems; Run time parameters; Run-time configuration; Runtime environments; Green computing","Energy efficiency; OpenMP; Overprovisioning; Power constrained system; Power-aware computing; Runtime parameter selection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065958245"

To solve it, a three-dimensional distance transform (3D-DT) algorithm, which is a variant of the three-dimensional Euclidean distance transform (3D-EDT), was previously designed. However, that algorithm is quite computationally intensive. In addition, the 3D-DT is inherently sequential, and it is thus challenging to parallelize. Thus, this study focuses on improving the sequential 3D-DT by transforming it into a parallel one. First, existing representative parallel EDT methods are reviewed and assessed. Then the railway alignment optimization model and the sequential 3D-DT are described. After that, critical execution properties of the 3D-DT that significantly influence its parallelization are explored in depth. Lastly, a novel so-called parallel linkage method is presented. This parallel implementation, which is developed using the OpenMP library, is highly effective and scalable by fully exploiting the parallelism of the algorithm. Using this parallel 3D-DT method, a large-scale, real-world railway case is tested and analyzed in detail. The outcomes verify that the proposed parallel method can accelerate the optimization process significantly without reducing the quality of computation results. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Parallel algorithms; Alignment optimization; Distance transforms; Engineering problems; Euclidean distance transforms; OpenMP; Parallel implementations; Parallelizations; Quality of computation; algorithm; civil engineering; numerical model; optimization; railway; three-dimensional modeling; Railroads","Alignment optimization; OpenMP; Parallel algorithms; Three-dimensional distance transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078243567"

Each WSN include many sensor nodes which have limited resources. These sensor nodes are connected together using base stations. The base stations are commonly network systems with conventional processors which are responsible for handling a large amount of communicated data in flows of network packets. For this purpose, classification of the communicated packets is considered the primary process in such systems. With the advent of high-performance multicore processors, developers in the network industry have considered these processors as a striking choice for implementing a wide range of flow-based wireless sensor networking applications. The main challenge in this field is choosing and exploiting an API which best allows multithreading; i.e. one which maximally hides the latency of performing complex operations by threads and increases the overall efficiency of the cores. This paper assesses the efficiency of Thread, Open Multiprocessing, and Threading Building Blocks (TBB) libraries in multithread implementation of set-pruning and grid-of-tries packet classification algorithms on dual-core and quad-core processors. In all cases, the speed and throughput of all parallel versions of the classification algorithms are much more than the corresponding serial versions. Moreover, for parallel classification of a sufficiently large number of packets by both classification algorithms, TBB library results in higher throughput and performance than the other libraries due to its automatic scheduling and internal task stealing mechanism. © TÜBİTAK","Base stations; Efficiency; Libraries; Multicore programming; Multitasking; Packet networks; Parallel processing systems; Sensor nodes; Classification algorithm; Open multiprocessings; Packet classification; Packet classification algorithm; Parallel classifications; Threading building blocks; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networkings; Application programming interfaces (API)","Efficiency; Multi-threading; Open Multiprocessing; Packet Classification; Thread; Threading Building Blocks; Wireless sensor network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084602853"

Web application interface (API) as an emerging technique attracts more and more enterprises and organizations to publish their deep computing functionalities and big data on the Internet, Web API has become the backbone to promote the development of SOC, thus forming the prosperousWeb API economy. However, the number of available Web APIs on the Internet is massive and growing constantly, which causes the Web API overload problem. Quality of service (QoS) as an indicator is able to well differentiate the quality of Web APIs and has been widely applied for high quality Web API selection. Since testing QoS for massive Web APIs is resource-consuming, and the QoS performance depends on contextual information such as network and location, hence accurate QoS prediction has become very crucial for personalizedWeb API recommendation and high quality Web application construction. To address the above issue, this paper presents a context aware deep factorization machine model (CADFM for short) for accurate Web API QoS prediction. Specifically, we first carry out detailed data analysis using real-world QoS dataset and discover a positive relationship between QoS and contextual information, which motivates us to incorporate beneficial contexts for enhancing QoS prediction accuracy. Then, we treat QoS prediction as a regression problem and propose a context aware CADFM framework that integrates the contextual information via embedding technique. Particularly, we adopt MF and MLP for high-order and nonlinear interaction modeling, so as to learn the complex interaction between users andWeb APIs accurately. Finally, the experimental results on real-world QoS dataset demonstrate that CADFM outperforms the classic and the state-of-the-art baselines, thereby generating the most accurate QoS predictions and increasing the revenue of Web APIs recommendation. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Existing pattern-based antivirus solutions face difficulties in coping with such a large number of new malicious files. To solve this problem, artificial intelligence (AI)-based malicious file detection methods have been proposed. However, even if we can detect malicious files with high accuracy using deep learning, it is difficult to identify why files are malicious. In this study, we propose a malicious file feature extraction method based on attention mechanism. First, by adapting the attention mechanism, we can identify application program interface (API) system calls that are more important than others for determining whether a file is malicious. Second, we confirm that this approach yields an accuracy that is approximately 12% and 5% higher than a conventional AI-based detection model using convolutional neural networks and skip-connected long short-term memory-based detection model, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, the imaging model of laser reflection tomography is established. Combining 3-D modeling with OpenGL processing, the imaging process of the laser reflection tomography is simulated. In simulated experiments, three kinds of laser pulse widths and three kinds of surface materials are considered, and their influences on the reconstructed image quality are compared and analyzed. Moreover, four kinds of object models are built to investigate the effects of shape on reflection tomography imaging. The experimental results demonstrate that the pulse width, surface material and geometric appearance make different influences on the imaging results.

Efficiency was achieved by developing both new hybrid quadrilateral and triangular elements. Quadrilateral element (QUAD+) was formulated by combining area geometric quadrilateral 6 (AGQ6) nodes and mixed interpolated tensorial components (MITC) to model membrane and bending/shear component respectively. Triangular element (TRIA+) was formulated by merging assumed natural deviatoric strain (ANDES) for membrane and MITC for bending/shear component. Flexibility was addressed by developing an open-source C++ code, enhanced by the OpenMP interface for multiprocessing programming. Tests and benchmarks were compiled and executed within Matlab using the MEX API interface. Extensive benchmark studies were accomplished to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid formulation and the shell formulations used in three FEM packages - ABAQUS, ANSYS and COMSOL- under static linear elastic condition with small strain assumption. It was observed that the proposed QUAD+ and TRIA+ elements performed better amongst the FE packages, especially when there was in-plane mesh distortion, with errors below 3%. It was also identified that the best efficiency is obtained by adopting dominant QUAD+ elements compared to the TRIA+ when working on complex geometries.

To improve the prediction accuracy, the proposed IMLE method approximates the total derivative term in Lagragian sense, and the spatial derivative terms are approximated on Eulerian coordinates. Transfer of data from Lagrangian particles to data on Eulerian grids is accurately carried out by adopting moving least squares (MLS) interpolation method. The velocity-pressure decoupling issue is overcome by adopting pressure-free projection method in which the pressure field is calculated by solving a pressure Poisson equation (PPE). It is noted that the MLS interpolation is time consuming since this procedure belongs to a pointwise scheme in which a local matrix equation shall be solved on each grid point. In addition, the discretized PPE forms a large sparse matrix and it is computationally intensive to solve by using the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Therefore, we are aimed to resort to CUDA- and OpenMP-programming means to accelerate the computation.

In this article, we address this shortcoming by proposing a rule-based behavioral malware detection system, which inherits the advantages of both signature and behavior-based approaches.

On-road fatalities are an unfortunate loss of life and lead to significant costs for society and the economy. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), envisaged as operating with idealised safety and cooperation, could be a means of mitigating these costs. This paper intends to provide insights into the safety improvements to be attained by incrementally transitioning the fleet to CAVs. This investigation is done by constructing a calibrated microsimulation environment in Vissim and deploying the custom developed Virdi CAV Control Protocol (VCCP) algorithm for CAV behaviour. The CAV behaviour is implemented using an application programming interface and a dynamic linking library. CAVs are introduced to the environment in 10% increments, and safety performance is assessed using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Module (SSAM). The results of this study show that CAVs at low penetrations result in an increase in conflicts at signalised intersections but a decrease at priority-controlled intersections. The initial 20% penetration of CAVs is accompanied by a +22%, −87%, −62% and +33% change in conflicts at the signalised, priority, roundabout and DDI intersection respectively.

A systematic investigation of six iterative methods, namely, symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR), Jacobi (J), conjugate gradient (CG), and three preconditioned CG methods (ie, J-PCG, block J-PCG [BJ-PCG], and SSOR-PCG), for solving equations in three-dimensional sphere DDA (SDDA) is conducted in this paper. Firstly, simultaneous equations of the SDDA and iterative formats of the six solvers are presented. Secondly, serial and OpenMP-based parallel computing numerical tests are done on a 16-core PC, the result of which shows that (a) for serial computing, the efficiency of the solvers is in this order: SSOR-PCG > BJ-PCG > J-PCG > SSOR>J > CG, while for parallel computing, BJ-PCG is the best solver; and (b) CG is not only the most sensitive to the ill-condition of the equations but also the most time consuming under both serial and parallel computing. Thirdly, to estimate the effects of equation solvers acting on SDDA computations, an application example with 10 000 spheres and 200 000 calculation steps is simulated on this 16-core PC using serial and parallel computing. The result shows that SSOR-PCG is about six times faster than CG for serial computing, while BJ-PCG is about four times faster than CG for parallel computing. On the other hand, the whole computation time using BJ-PCG for parallel computing is 3.37 hours (ie, 0.061 s per step), which is about 36 times faster than CG for serial computing.

The entire process is time consuming, which leads to low efficiency for practical system executing batch analysis for a considerable scale of apps. In order to enhance the speed of API calls tracking, in this paper, we propose a static analysis method, called EstiDroid, to estimate API calls of Android apps by statically analyzing the apps without actually running them. EstiDroid is composed of a static analyzer and an estimation algorithm. To analyze a target app, EstiDroid first obtains several types of static information from the app's.APK file via the static analyzer, then, the estimation algorithm is employed to establish the estimation model for the app based on the static information. Finally, according to the model, the proportion of each API's calls in the total number of calls is estimated. In experiments, 300 apps are tested via EstiDroid and manual operation in smartphone, the results show that EstiDroid only consumed 49242ms on average compared with manual testing, and it reached 84.06% average similarity and 90.74% maximum similarity compared with the API calls tracked in real environments. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Static analysis; Android applications; Average similarities; Estimation algorithm; Operating environment; Real environments; Sensitive informations; Static analysis method; Static information; Android (operating system)","Android; API calls tracking; application behavior; smartphone; static analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086709801"

Many approaches have been proposed to distinguish malicious applications from benign ones, but few of them can represent the behavior patterns of malicious applications and help understand their intention. In this paper, we propose LSCDroid, a malware detecting approach that cannot only detect malware but also help understand the malware's intention by analyzing its behavior patterns. LSCDroid uses local sensitive application programming interface (API) invocation (LSAI) sequences as features to detect malware and represent different malicious behavior patterns. We first extract LSAI sequences of malicious applications based on their function-call graphs. After removing redundant sequences and merging fragmented ones, we obtain a set of LSAI sequences that can be used to effectively detect malicious applications. We further manually analyze the semantic of the obtained sequences and find that a large fraction of them can be used to characterize different behavior patterns of malware and help understand their intention, e.g., sending SMS message stealthily, obtaining geographical information, remote control, and root privilege. We design a machine learning based malware detection and classification algorithm by taking the obtained sequences as input features. Experimental results show that the accuracy and recall of LSCDroid on multiple datasets are both higher than 0.98. Meanwhile, LSCDroid can classify malware families with an accuracy higher than 0.96. Moreover, LSCDroid can represent the behavior patterns and help understand intention of malware by mapping their LSAI sequences to some typical malicious behaviors. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Feature extraction; Machine learning; Malware; Remote control; Semantics; Android applications; Classification algorithm; Function-call graphs; Geographical information; Malicious behavior; Malware detection; Redundant sequences; Sensitive application; Mobile security","Android application detection; malicious behavior pattern; malware detection; sensitive application programming interface (API) invocation sequences","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081700537"

This brings up many multimedia context-aware services, among which real time locating system (RTLS) has become necessary in many applications. To locate a mobile station (MS), RTLS could apply conventional fingerprinting algorithm using received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which allows a MS to collect RSSI data from beacons sent by access points (APs). However, this method does not work for iPhones because of the lack of open access to Apple application programming interface (API) to obtain RSSI values. This paper proposes an alternative approach, under which APs in the monitoring mode are used to collect RSSI values for semi-beacon packets sent from a MS. We implement the packet capture library, which enables us to obtain RSSI values of semi-beacon packets sent by an iPhone. With a region-based k-nearest neighbor (kNN) localization algorithm, we successfully locate an iPhone user in indoor environment. In addition, experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional RSSI fingerprinting approach. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computer systems programming; Fruits; Indoor positioning systems; Information services; Mobile computing; Multimedia services; Nearest neighbor search; Smartphones; Cross compilation; Openwrt; Real time location systems; Socket programming; Wireless localization; Application programming interfaces (API)","Application programming interface; Cross compilation; Cross compilation; OpenWrt; Real-time location system; Socket programming; Wireless localization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076895888"

Therefore, from the network edge, heterogeneous solutions can be provided to the Internet based on sufficient computing ability. Nevertheless, computing and networking resources are constrained for devices in the network edge. Providing secure services from edge computing is a challenge based on constrained resources. In this paper, we propose a secure edge computing to provide management of device, data, user and additional services based on deploying independent microservices providers with a security gateway on an edge gateway. The edge gateway is the hub of a local network where multiple IoT devices are deployed to interact with the physical environment for sensing and actuating. The gateway provides the management functionalities through microservices based on multiple independent server modules. Each gateway-centric local network has a standalone management service based on the gateway. For providing secure edge computing services through the edge gateway, a security gateway is deployed on the proposed edge gateway to provide Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces to expose the security services to the Internet instead of microservices from management modules. Moreover, a client support gateway is deployed in the edge gateway to provide services of User Interface and access forwarding based on web sessions to support user authentication and authorization with the security gateway. Based on the proposed edge gateway including client support and security gateway, IoT clients and IoT devices are enabled to communicate for providing secure edge services of access and visualization to users. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Sets of node-energy response and associated matrices are assigned evenly to the available set of MPI processors and OpenMP is further employed to parallelize integrations over angle in the response matrix formation. Parallelization of the solution algorithm is accomplished using non-overlapping domain decomposition with one MPI processor assigned to each subdomain. Additionally, the red and black subdomain iterations of the within-group equations are parallelized by OpenMP. Only the pre-calculated matrix sets needed in a subdomain are stored in the corresponding processor. This parallel solution strategy preserves the block Gauss-Seidel red-black iterations employed in serial calculation, with data transfer between processors only after each red and black iteration. Partitioned matrix acceleration is implemented in a similar manner. These parallel algorithms are implemented in the code PANX allowing both higher-order space-angle approximations to be employed and larger spatial domains to be treated than was the case with the serial form of the code. The KAIST problem is used to both evaluate the parallel performance and demonstrate the increased accuracy of the higher-order angular approximations. With 27 MPI processors and 4 OpenMP threads, speedups of nearly 39 are obtained. To demonstrate the applicability of parallel algorithms to larger spatial domains, a pin-resolved, three-dimensional seven-group model of the NuScale modular reactor core with sufficiently high order space-angle discretization is employed using 49 MPI processors and 4 OpenMP threads, and completed in 4 h with P3 approximation. © 2019","Application programming interfaces (API); Approximation algorithms; Data transfer; Domain decomposition methods; Finite element method; Neutron flux; Parallel algorithms; Parallel processing systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; Transport properties; Associated matrices; Hybrid parallelization; Neutron transport calculations; Nonoverlapping domain decomposition; Parallel performance; Pin-resolved; Spherical harmonics method; Variational nodal method; Iterative methods","Finite element method; Hybrid parallelization; Pin-resolved; Spherical harmonics method; Variational nodal method","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065668638"

However, manually developing a prototype of a software system requires additional efforts, which would increase the overall cost of software development. In this article, we present an approach with a developed tool RM2PT to automated prototype generation from formal requirements models for requirements validation. A requirements model consists of a use case diagram, a conceptual class diagram, use case definitions specified by system sequence diagrams, and the contracts of their system operations. A system operation contract is formally specified by a pair of pre and postconditions in object constraint language. We propose a method with a set of transformation rules to decompose a contract into executable parts and nonexecutable parts. An executable part can be automatically transformed into a sequence of primitive operations by applying their corresponding rules, and a nonexecutable part is not transformable with the rules. The tool RM2PT provides a mechanism for developers to develop a piece of program for each nonexecutable part manually, which can be plugged into the generated prototype source code automatically. We have conducted four case studies with over 50 use cases. The experimental result shows that the 93.65% system operations are executable, and only 6.35% are nonexecutable, which can be implemented by developers manually or invoking the third-party application programming interface (APIs).

To allow full interoperability between different manufacturers' equipment, common methods for discovery, registration, and connection management of media devices are essential. The Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA) has been developing the Networked Media Open Specifications (NMOS) for this purpose, leading to the publication of interface specifications, including IS-04 for discovery/registration of NMOS Nodes and IS-05 for management of connections between Nodes. These use RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate between applications and devices and are gaining widespread adoption. A key requirement within the industry is that these APIs scale successfully in the very large installations typical of real-world deployments. To help address this, Sony has been leading an AMWA NMOS Scalability study to test these protocols for installations comprising thousands of media devices.

To achieve a successful future market take-up of MaaS it is important to develop prototype business models to offer high-value bundled mobility services to customers, as well as enable the MaaS operator and the involved actors to capture value. This paper aims at investigating the business perspective of MaaS by collecting qualitative data from workshops and in-depth interviews in three European metropolitan areas: Budapest, Greater Manchester and the city of Luxembourg. The analysis of the collected data contributed to the in-depth analysis of the MaaS business ecosystem and the identification of the champions of MaaS in the three areas. Prototype business models for MaaS are developed based on the Osterwalder's canvas, to describe how MaaS operators may create, deliver, and capture value. Our findings indicate that the MaaS ecosystem comprises of public and private actors who need to cooperate and compete in order to capture value. Although noticeable deviations among the study areas are observed, mobility service providers, public transport authorities and regional authorities were commonly indicated as the key actors in a MaaS partnership. In addition, viewed as a system, enablers and barriers to MaaS are identified based on the systems’ of innovation approach. The analysis indicates that the regulatory framework of the cities, the lack of standardization and openness of the application programming interfaces and the need for transport-related investments constitute risks for the successful implementation of MaaS in the study areas.

Melt temperature, injection time, cooling time, mold temperature, packing pressure, and packing time are considered as optimization parameters.

However, simply solving these equations is not sufficient to be able to perform efficient design optimization with a flow solver in the loop. This paper discusses the recommendations for developing a flow solver that is suitable for efficient aerodynamic and multidisciplinary design optimization. One of the major recommendations is to be able to load the flow solver as a library that provides direct memory access to the relevant data. Other recommendations are to use a higher-level language for scripting and to pay special attention to solution warm starting, code efficiency, flow solver robustness, and solution failure handling. As an example of a flow solver that follows these recommendations, the open-source flow solver ADflow is presented. Results from aerodynamic optimization, aerostructural analysis, and aerostructural optimization using ADflow demonstrate the performance advantages claimed in the recommendations. The publication of these recommendations and the availability of the source code open the door for other solvers to adopt the same application programming interface.

Moreover, they do not support flexible permission models, and they are often tightly coupled with a specific SDN controller. To address such limitations, we introduce an automated permission generation and verification system called VOGUE. A distinguishing aspect of VOGUE is that it automatically generates flexible permission models and yet is completely separated from the SDN controller implementation. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement a prototype, evaluate its completeness and soundness, and examine its performance.

Interactive simulation is an emerging field in engineering with use cases appearing in design, analysis and communication.

The software consists of a 2D Lattice-Boltzmann Method flow physics solver, implemented using OpenGL ES 3.2, as well as a communication library which uses Wi-Fi Direct to communicate between connected devices. We compare the performance of the OpenGL-based solver against existing implementations in CUDA and demonstrate similar computational throughput. We also test a variety of communication strategies based on configurations of GPU memory mapping and communication frequency. Results confirm that passing large amounts of data infrequently offers the best overall efficiency. However, due to the extended time required to pass larger amounts of data to adjacent devices, this configuration can introduce an undesirable stuttering in an interactive application. Finally, comparisons between two and three device networks to the serial case show that, despite the inevitable cost of communication, it is possible to maintain an interactive frame rate across multiple devices; the extension of calculations across multiple devices in this way, allows the tackling of problems which are larger and of higher-resolution that previous. © 2019","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Distributed computer systems; Flow simulation; Graphics processing unit; Kinetic theory; Mobile computing; Program processors; Communication frequency; Communication strategy; GPGPU computing; Interactive applications; Interactive frame rates; Interactive simulations; Large amounts of data; Lattice Boltzmann method; Computational fluid dynamics","Distributed computing; GPGPU Computing; Lattice-Boltzmann method; Mobile computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064520984"

Design/methodology/approach: The semi-Lagrangian-based solvers are typically PB, i.e. semi-Lagrangian pressure-based (SLPB) solvers, where a Poisson equation is solved for obtaining the pressure field and ensuring a divergence-free flow field. As an elliptic-type equation, the Poisson equation often relies on an iterative solution, so it can create a challenge of parallel computing and a bottleneck of computing speed. This study proposes a new DB semi-Lagrangian method, i.e. the semi-Lagrangian artificial compressibility (SLAC), which replaces the Poisson equation by a hyperbolic continuity equation with an added artificial compressibility (AC) term, so a time-marching solution is possible. Without the Poisson equation, the proposed SLAC solver is faster, particularly for the cases with more computational cells, and better suited for parallel computing. Findings: The study compares the accuracy and the computing speeds of both SLPB and SLAC solvers for the lid-driven cavity flow and the step-flow problems. It shows that the proposed SLAC solver is able to achieve the same results as the SLPB, whereas with a 3.03 times speed up before using the OpenMP parallelization and a 3.35 times speed up for the large grid number case (512 × 512) after the parallelization.

However, the protocol is restricted to a small number of peers because there is no simple way to mix real-time streams from multiple peers and then distribute the mixed stream to a large number of audiences. For example, it is necessary to mix audio and video streams from peers in a conversation and broadcast the real-time mixed stream to more than 10k audiences who only watch the video. It is also necessary to blend synchronous content (e.g., logos, music) to the live conversation stream. WebRTC does not currently provide a mechanism to easily support these cases. This paper proposes a method for the synchronized mixing of real-time audio/video streams from multiple peers while minimizing latency. This method enables the implementation of an online live conversation system that is able to mix live conversation streams from multiple peers and then rebroadcast the mixed stream to a large number of audiences. © 2020 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Mixing; Audio and video; Conversation systems; Javascript; Live streaming; Peer-to-peer connections; Protocol cans; Real-time audio; Real-time streams; Peer to peer networks","live streaming; media synchronization; real-time multimedia communications; synchronization mechanism; WebRTC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084156199"

The design and implementation of a parallel tiled WZ factorization algorithm which can fully exploit such architectures are presented. Three parallel implementations of the algorithm are studied.

The second implementation, except for BLAS operations, employs the OpenMP standard to use the loop-level parallelism. The third implementation, except for BLAS operations, employs the OpenMP task directive with the depend clause. We report the computational performance and the speedup of the parallel tiled WZ factorization algorithm on shared memory multicore architectures for dense square diagonally dominant matrices.

The butter layer is applied to minimize carbon diffusion from the base metal to the welding pool and to eliminate the risk of the formation of a hard martensitic layer at the fusion line. The microstructures of buttered and non-buttered specimens were studied using the optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Mechanical properties of the joints were also evaluated using standard and sub-sized tensile and impact tests. Hardness profilometry was also conducted across the weldments. Results showed that the application of the butter layer results in the elimination of a rather large brittle martensitic layer from the base metal at the API side. Also, it appears that the weld zone in the buttered sample hardly has any δ-ferrite, which has to do with a high nickel content of the butter layer. Butter layer overall decreases the tensile strength and increases the elongation/ductility of the joints. More importantly, the butter layer essentially acts as a barrier layer between the ferritic side of the weldment and the weld pool, and this, in turn, eliminates two hardness peaks at both sides of the welding pool. The correlations between microstructure and mechanical properties are comprehensively investigated and discussed. © 2019 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Backscattering; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ferrite; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Hardness; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Welds; Aisi-304; API 5L X65; Butter layer; Dissimilar welding; Electron backscattering diffraction; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Gas tungsten arc welding; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Application programming interfaces (API)","AISI304; API 5L X65; Butter layer; Dissimilar welding; Mechanical properties","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077043708"

It is a computationally intensive task that suits well in parallel computers. Methods such as RTM can be parallelized in shared memory systems through scheduling iterations of parallel loops to threads. However, several aspects, such as memory size and hierarchy, number of cores, and input size, make optimal scheduling very challenging. In this paper, we introduce a run-time strategy to automatically tune the dynamic scheduling of parallel loops iterations in iterative applications, such as the RTM, in multicore systems. The proposed method aims to reduce the execution time of such applications. To find the optimal granularity, we propose a coupled simulated annealing (CSA) based auto-tuning strategy that adjusts the chunk size of work that OpenMP parallel loops assign dynamically to worker threads during the initialization of a 3D RTM application. Experiments performed with different computational systems and input sizes show that the proposed method is consistently better than the default OpenMP schedulers, static, auto, and guided, causing the application to be up to 33% faster. We show that the possible reason for this performance is the reduction of cache misses, mainly level L3, and low overhead, inferior to 2%. Having shown to be robust and scalable for the 3D RTM, the proposed method could also improve the performance of similar wave-based algorithms, such as full-waveform inversion (FWI) and other iterative applications.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Gas industry; Iterative methods; Petroleum industry; Scheduling; Seismology; Simulated annealing; Computational system; Dynamic scheduling; Full-waveform inversion; Multi-core systems; Oil and Gas Industry; Optimal scheduling; Reverse time migrations; Shared memory system; Seismic prospecting","Auto-tuning; coupled simulated annealing; dynamic scheduling; openMP; reverse time migration","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090281904"

The proposed solution is based on software-defined networking (SDN) in order to implement novel traffic engineering (TE) techniques. In fact, most standards development organizations and researchers agree that the logically centralized control plane and high programmability of SDN can revolutionize TE with novel and powerful strategies. In this context, the dynamic path computation (DynPaC) framework, relies on the OpenFlow SDN protocol to provide resilient layer 2 services with bandwidth guarantees within OpenFlow domains. In order to make DynPaC support multi-domain service provisioning, it has been extended with an additional operational mode and REST API calls, making it fully compliant with the Network Services Interface-Connection Service protocol. In this way, DynPaC can behave as a network resource manager (NRM) in the network services framework. As a result, the presented solution is the first OpenFlow-enabled NRM with resiliency capabilities that implements novel TE strategies that enhance the utilization of network resources. In order to validate the proposal, it has been implemented using the ONOS network operating systems and several tests have been conducted using diverse service demand patterns.

Recent developments in deep learning have led to considerable research activity directed towards improving the efficacy of automated pavement distress identification and rating. Deep learning models require a large ground truth data set, which is often not readily available in the case of pavements. In this study, a labeled dataset approach is introduced as a first step towards a more robust, easy-to-deploy pavement condition assessment system. The technique is termed herein as the pavement image dataset (PID) method. The dataset consists of images captured from two camera views of an identical pavement segment, that is, a wide view and a top-down view. The wide-view images were used to classify the distresses and to train the deep learning frameworks, while the top-down-view images allowed calculation of distress density, which will be used in future studies aimed at automated pavement rating. For the wide view group dataset, 7,237 images were manually annotated and distresses classified into nine categories. Images were extracted using the Google application programming interface (API), selecting street-view images using a python-based code developed for this project. The new dataset was evaluated using two mainstream deep learning frameworks: You Only Look Once (YOLO v2) and Faster Region Convolution Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). Accuracy scores using the F1 index were found to be 0.84 for YOLOv2 and 0.65 for the Faster R-CNN model runs; both quite acceptable considering the convenience of utilizing Google Maps images. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.","Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Image segmentation; Pavements; Turnaround time; Benchmark datasets; Convolution neural network; Google application programming interfaces; Ground truth data; Learning frameworks; Pavement condition assessment; Pavement segments; Research activities; Classification (of information)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085990601"

Several simulators have been used to evaluate the performance and power consumed by network-on-chips (NoCs). To speedup the simulations, it is necessary to investigate and optimize the hotspots in the simulator source code. Among several simulators available, Booksim2.0 has been chosen for the experimentation as it is being extensively used in the NoC community. In this paper, the cache and memory system behavior of Booksim2.0 have been analyzed to accurately monitor input dependent performance bottlenecks. The measurements show that cache and memory usage patterns vary widely based on the input parameters given to Booksim2.0. Based on these measurements, the cache configuration having the least misses has been identified. To further reduce the cache misses, software optimization techniques such as removal of unused functions, loop interchanging and replacing post-increment operator with pre-increment operator for non-primitive data types have been employed. The cache misses were reduced by 18.52%, 5.34% and 3.91% by employing above technology respectively. Thread parallelization and vectorization have been employed to improve the overall performance of Booksim2.0. The OpenMP programming model and SIMD are used for parallelizing and vectorizing the more time-consuming portions of Booksim2.0. Speedups of 2.93× and 3.97× were observed for the Mesh topology with 30 × 30 network size by employing thread parallelization and vectorization respectively. © 2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cache memory; Fault tolerant computer systems; Simulators; Cache behaviour; Cache configurations; Hot spot; Parallelizations; Performance bottlenecks; Performance profiling; Programming models; Software optimization; Network-on-chip","Cache behaviour; Hotspot analysis; Network-on-chip; Parallelization; Performance profiling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065971761"

Second, a CNN model is used to extract the feature vectors of these virtual images. Then, these feature vectors as the input of an RNN are fused into a new feature to represent the 3D model. Finally, the Euclidean distance is used to obtain the similarity measure between two different models for the retrieval problem.

With an increasing robot demand, many universities offer robotics courses. These courses teach students the mathematical principles of robot-related algorithms. However, it is difficult for students to apply pure mathematical algorithms in robotics to real robot development in a traditional classroom. This paper's motivation is to present a new robotics teaching method: Algorithm, Virtual experiment, Programming and Controller (AVPC), which shows students the steps of complete robot algorithm development, verification, and application process, taking the kinematics of an educational desktop 6-DOF robotic arm as a typical teaching case. For the low-cost educational desktop six-axis robotic arm, an inverse kinematics algorithm is proposed. The inverse solution algorithm is realized in MATLAB, and then the dynamic model of the desktop robotic arm is established in Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP). The inverse kinematics algorithm in MATLAB is used to control the virtual robot arm movement in V-REP to the specified position and orientation through the application programming interface (API) interface, thus verifying the correctness of the inverse kinematics algorithm. The inverse algorithm is implemented by using C language function in the microcontroller, and the running time of the algorithm is compared with that of the iterative solution method. In the present study, we investigated the students’ feelings and exam scores of using the new teaching method. The results show that the new teaching method has a significant impact on the improvement of students’ learning effect of robotics. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Application programming interfaces (API); C (programming language); Curricula; Education computing; Educational robots; Inverse kinematics; Inverse problems; Iterative methods; MATLAB; Robotic arms; Robotics; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Desktop robot; Experimentation platforms; Inverse kinematics algorithms; Iterative solution methods; Mathematical algorithms; Mathematical principle; Position and orientations; Robotics education; Robot programming","desktop robot; inverse kinematics; MATLAB; robotics education; V-REP","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076755811"

Therefore, we aim to build a data-driven predictive application for screening subjects at a high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the western region of Saudi Arabia. In this context, we designed and implemented a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using conventional diabetes risk factors for studying the prevalence and the association between the outcomes and exposure (s). We used the Chi-Squared test and binary logistic regression to analyze and screen the most significant diabetes risk factor for T2DM risk prediction. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), a class-balancer, was used to balance the cross-sectional data. We used the balanced class data to screen the best performing classification algorithm to classify patients at high risk of diabetes with a higher F1 Score. The best performing classifier's hyper-parameters were further tuned using 10-fold cross-validation for achieving an improved F1 Score. Additionally, we validated our proposed model with the existing models built using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The results of the Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression showed that the exposures, namely Smoking, Healthy diet, Blood-Pressure (BP), Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Region, contributed significantly (p < 0.05) to the prediction of the Response variable (subjects at high risk of diabetes). The tuned two-class Decision Forest (DF) model showed better performance with an average F1score of 0.8453 ± 0.0268. Moreover, the DF based model adapted reasonably well in different diabetes dataset.

However, this enormous growth of Web services increases the difficulty of selecting the best suitable Web services for a particular application. Hence, the design of an effective and efficient Web service recommendation, primarily based on user feedback, has become a challenge. In the mashup-API recommendation scenario, the most available feedback is the implicit invocation data, i.e., the binary data indicating whether or not a mashup has invoked an API. Various efforts are exploiting potential impact factors, such as the invocation context, to augment the implicit invocation data with the aim to improve service recommendation performance. One significant factor affecting the context of Web service invocations is geographical location, but it has been given less attention in the implicit-based service recommendation. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic matrix factorization based recommendation approach, which considers geographic location information in the derivation of the preference degree underlying a mashup-API interaction. The geographic information, which is integrated with functional descriptions, complements the mashup-API invocation data input for our matrix factorization model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting extensive experiments on a real dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb. The evaluation results show that augmenting the implicit data with geographical location information increases the precision of API recommendation for mashup services. © 2020","Application programming interfaces (API); Collaborative filtering; Computer software reusability; Factorization; Location; Location based services; Matrix algebra; Open Data; Websites; Applications development; Geographical location information; Implicit feedback; Matrix factorizations; Probabilistic matrix factorizations; Recommendation; Topic Modeling; Web service recommendations; Web services","Implicit feedback; Location; Matrix factorization; Recommendation; Topic model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081129082"

In the current era of conglomerate-acquired technologies, large-scale marketing departments will pay top dollar to get air cover from analysts (such as paying for a dot on the Gartner Magic Quadrant) to claim universal capabilities in niche market segments. The term ‘security’ when used in the context of application programming interface (API) and identity access management (IAM) solutions doesn't always mean what you might expect. Many frameworks aimed at these areas are often little more than increasingly large collections of features built on a baseline that is inherently insecure, argues Jason Macy of Forum Systems.

The integrated simulator exploits some already existing tools to simulate a specific part of the overall Unmanned aerial vehicle hardware and software structure: a 3D visualization engine, a physics simulator, a flight control stack and a network simulator to handle communications among Unmanned aerial vehicles.

Our interest is to apply image-based cognitive APIs to implement flexible and efficient context sensing services in a smart home. In the existing approach with machine learning by us, with the complexity of recognition object and the number of the defined contexts increases by users, it still requires directly manually labeling a moderate scale of data for training and continually try to calling multiple cognitive APIs for feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses a small scale of labeled data to evaluate the capability of cognitive APIs in advance, before training features of the APIs with machine learning, for the flexible and efficient home context sensing. In the proposed method, we exploit document similarity measures and the concepts (i.e., internal cohesion and external isolation) integrate into clustering results, to see how the capability of different cognitive APIs for recognizing each context. By selecting the cognitive APIs that relatively adapt to the defined contexts and data based on the evaluation results, we have achieved the flexible integration and efficient process of cognitive APIs for home context sensing. © 2020 by the authors.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate how these effects can be calculated in more practical way in a shorter time. The effects of semi-rigid column bases are taken into account in optimum design of steel space frames. This study is carried out by using JAYA algorithm which is a novel and practical method based on a single revision equation.

Four different steel space frames including soil structure interaction taken from literature are investigated according to different semi-rigidly supported models depending on different rotational stiffness values. And the results obtained from analyses are compared with the results available in reference studies. The results of the study show that semi-rigidly supported systems in the range of appropriate rotational stiffness values offer practical solutions in a very short time.

Unlike the data center and cloud storage systems, it employs edge devices to perform encoding and decoding operations, which can be a performance bottleneck of the whole storage system due to limited computing power. Hence, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of erasure coding to see if it can match the network performance of 5G and Wi-Fi 6 at the network edge. We use the popular edge device Jetson Nano and two state-of-the-art coding libraries: Jerasure and G-CRS.

This ADI integration is based on a second-order implicit Crank-Nicolson temporal discretization that is factored out by a Peaceman-Rachford decomposition of the time and space equation terms. In space, these methods highly diverge and apply different fourth-order accurate differentiation techniques. The first method uses compact finite differences (CFD) on nodal meshes that requires solving tridiagonal linear systems along each grid line, while the second one employs staggered-grid mimetic finite differences (MFD). For each method, we implement three parallel versions: (i) a multithreaded code in Octave, (ii) a C++ code that exploits OpenMP loop parallelization, and (iii) a CUDA kernel for a NVIDIA GTX 960 Maxwell card. In these implementations, the main source of parallelism is the simultaneous ADI updating of each wave field matrix, either column-wise or row-wise, according to the differentiation direction. In our numerical applications, the highest performances are displayed by the CFD and MFD CUDA codes that achieve speedups of 7.21x and 15.81x, respectively, relative to their C++ sequential counterparts with optimal compilation flags. Our test cases also allow to assess the numerical convergence and accuracy of both methods. In a problem with exact harmonic solution, both methods exhibit convergence rates close to 4 and the MDF accuracy is practically higher. Alternatively, both convergences decay to second order on smooth problems with severe gradients at boundaries, and the MDF rates degrade in highly-resolved grids leading to larger inaccuracies. This transition of empirical convergences agrees with the nominal truncation errors in space and time. © 2020","Acoustic waves; Acoustics; Application programming interfaces (API); C++ (programming language); Convergence of numerical methods; Finite difference method; Linear systems; Optical resonators; Alternating direction implicit; Compact finite differences; Convergence rates; Loop parallelization; Numerical applications; Numerical convergence; Rectangular grids; Temporal discretization; Acoustic wave propagation","ADI; Compact finite differences; CUDA and OpenMP programming; Mimetic operators","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084949523"

Those systems involve two main properties: reactivity and predictability. Reactivity allows the system to continuously react to a non-deterministic external environment, while predictability guarantees the deterministic execution of safety-critical parts of applications.However, with the increase in software complexity, traditional approaches to develop real-time systems make temporal behaviors difficult to infer, especially when the system is required to address non-deterministic aperiodic events from the physical environment. In this article, we propose a reactive and predictable programming framework, Distributed Clockwerk (DCW), for distributed real-time systems. DCWintroduces the Servant, which is a non-preemptible execution entity, to implement periodic tasks based on the Logical Execution Time (LET) model. Furthermore, a joint schedule policy, based on the slack stealing algorithm, is proposed to efficiently address aperiodic events with no violated hard-time constraints. To further support predictable communication among distributed nodes, DCW implements the Time-Triggered Controller Area Network (TTCAN) to avoid collisions while accessing the shared communication medium. Moreover, a programming framework implements to provide a set of programming APIs for defining timing and functional behaviors of concurrent tasks. An example is further implemented to illustrate the DCW design flow. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposal can improve both periodic and aperiodic reactivity compared with existing work, and the implemented DCW can also ensure the system predictability by achieving extremely low overheads. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Application programming interfaces (API); Control system synthesis; Distributed computer systems; Functional programming; Interactive computer systems; Reactivity (nuclear); Safety engineering; Controller area network; Deterministic execution; Distributed real time system; Logical execution time; Predictability; Programming framework; Shared communication medium; Traditional approaches; Real time systems","Distributed real-time systems; Logical execution time; Predictability; Reactivity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067800484"

CAVs have the potential to vastly improve road safety by taking the human driver out of the driving task. However, the evaluation of their safety impacts has been a major challenge due to the lack of real-world CAV exposure data. Studies that attempt to simulate CAVs by using either a single or integrating multiple simulation platforms have limitations, and in most cases, consider a small element of a network (e.g. a junction) and do not perform safety evaluations due to inherent complexity. This paper addresses this problem by developing a decision-making CAV control algorithm in the simulation software VISSIM, using its External Driver Model Application Programming Interface. More specifically, the developed CAV control algorithm allows a CAV, for the first time, to have longitudinal control, search adjacent vehicles, identify nearby CAVs and make lateral decisions based on a ruleset associated with motorway traffic operations. A motorway corridor within M1 in England is designed in VISSIM and employed to implement the CAV control algorithm. Five simulation models are created, one for each weekday. The baseline models (i.e. CAV market penetration: 0%) are calibrated and validated using real-world minute-level inductive loop detector data and also data collected from a radar-equipped vehicle. The safety evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). The results show that CAVs bring about compelling benefit to road safety as traffic conflicts significantly reduce even at relatively low market penetration rates. Specifically, estimated traffic conflicts were reduced by 12–47%, 50–80%, 82–92% and 90–94% for 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% CAV penetration rates respectively. Finally, the results indicate that the presence of CAVs ensured efficient traffic flow. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accidents, Traffic; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Automobile Driving; Calibration; Decision Making; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Safety; Software; Accident prevention; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Commerce; Decision making; Longitudinal control; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Autonomous Vehicles; Driver modeling; Road safety; Safety assessments; Traffic micro simulations; VISSIM; algorithm; artificial intelligence; calibration; car driving; decision making; human; motor vehicle; prevention and control; safety; software; standards; traffic accident; validation study; Vehicles","Connected and Autonomous vehicles; External Driver Model; Road safety; Surrogate Safety Assessment Model; Traffic microsimulation; VISSIM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059327033"

The developed TPM has the following characteristics. First, the TPM is driven by three rodless pneumatic actuators and is designed as a horizontal structure to enlarge its horizontal working space to cover a conveyor. Then, a robot-vision system (including a webcam mounted on the TPM) collects images of objects on the conveyor and transfers them through the LabVIEW application programming interface for image processing. Since it is very difficult to achieve precise position control of the TPM due to the nonlinear couplings among the robot axes, feedback linearization is utilized to design an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy controller with self-tuning fuzzy sliding-mode compensation (AIT2FC-STFSMC) for each rodless pneumatic actuator to attenuate nonlinearities, function approximation errors, and external disturbances. Finally, experiments proved that the vision-based three degree-of-freedom TPM was capable of accurately tracking desired trajectories and precisely executing pick-and-place movement in real time. © 2019 by the authors.

According to our statistical analysis (Chi-square test), consumers that can pay using different (M)EPS during their online payment transaction, have a preferred payment system based on its security, fees, usefulness, and ease of use as well as on their favorite Web browser for these transactions. Factor analysis was also performed to identify factors that much influence the (M)EPS. Results revealed that the factors influencing online payment preferences differ from those involved in traditional payment methods. Our findings allowed, therefore, providing practical suggestions for supporting payment processes with Web browsers and the W3C payment Application Program Interface (API). © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Electronic commerce; Global system for mobile communications; Industrial research; Online systems; Statistical tests; Surveys; Ease-of-use; Electronic payment systems; Mobile payment system; payment preference; Perceived securities; Technology acceptance model; Web browsers","ease of use; Electronic payment systems; mobile payment systems; payment preference; perceived security; technology acceptance model (TAM)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078708953"

Thus, many researches of service ecosystem focus on issues related to optimization such as service recommendation and load balancing, so the API popularity prediction problem studied in this paper, which is basis for this service ecosystem optimization, becomes a research hotspot in this field. However, many existing researches are predicting the popularity of APIs based on API functions, QoS, history usage patterns and social relationships, which are difficult to obtain and cannot reflect the overall structure of the underlying service ecosystem. Therefore, we propose an innovative API popularity prediction method in service ecosystem based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). Concretely, a Global-Service Ecosystem Network (GSEN) model is proposed firstly, for modeling a given service ecosystem to a network that can depict the complex structure of service ecosystem and the functions, QoS, history usage patterns and social relationships of APIs. Then, a Graph Heterogeneous Spatiotemporal Convolutional Network (GHSCN) model is proposed to predict the popularity of APIs based on GSEN, and for getting better prediction accuracy, four different Heterogeneous Spatiotemporal Convolutional Kernels are proposed to extract the features of different elements which have different mechanisms to affect the popularity of target API. Finally, extensive experiments based on the data crawled from ProgrammableWeb.com show that our method achieves a superior performance in API popularity prediction, and the importance of the introduction of our model to service ecosystems.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Complex networks; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Social aspects; Business requirement; Convolutional kernel; Convolutional networks; Different mechanisms; Graph neural networks; Prediction accuracy; Service recommendations; Social relationships; Ecosystems","API popularity prediction; GHSCN; graph neural network; service ecosystem","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090385007"

In the first level, the algorithm precalculates the subband wave functions corresponding to fixed energies and archives the results in a file-based cache to reduce memory consumption. In the second level, we compute the spin relaxation time by using the archived data in parallel.

The objectives of this study are: 1) to catalogue all the publicly available API data streams for NMS in three major cities known as the Cascadia Corridor (Vancouver, British Columbia; Seattle, Washington; and Portland, Oregon); 2) to create, apply, and share web data extraction tools (Python scripts) for each API; and 3) to assess the usefulness of the extracted data in quantifying supply and demand for each service. Results reveal some measures of supply and demand that can be extracted from API data and be useful in future analysis (mostly for bikeshare and carshare services, not ridesourcing). However, important information on supply and demand of most of the NMS in these cities cannot be obtained through API data extraction.

In order to overcome the deficiency of the distance-based IDP (Inverse Distance to a Power) interpolation algorithm, an interpolation algorithm based on elevation and distance weighting is proposed to obtain the DSM to be further filtered. In this paper, the original laser point cloud data near the Xinyan rode in Beijing is taken as an example, and the data is processed by the algorithm based on threshold segmentation and mathematical morphology (TSMM) to extract the DTM. Finally, the 3D visualization of DTM is realized by the program based on MFC and OpenGL. The experimental data and practices in engineering show that the TSMM algorithm can successfully separate and display the surface points and surface features and extract the DTM close to the real ground to provide the foundation for further research. © 2019 Totem Publisher, Inc.

Further, this study used hyper-heuristic optimisation to obtain the lane-changing advisory proportion of each segment upstream of lane drop. Conditions of different traffic demands were analysed using the microscopic traffic simulation software AIMSUN and its Application Program Interface (API) function. Results indicated that the proposed lane-changing advisory strategy could reduce traffic congestion and obviously improve traffic efficiency.

Different basic case studies have been presented to envision the possibilities of this system in the future and more complex scenarios, to actively support the DLC strategies.

It is well-known that the process of a complex simulated design can be considerably accelerated by using some form of parallel computing. Also, for many tribological models additional assumptions can be relaxed with stricter design constrains, if the execution can be speeded up. In this study, the concurrent computing for tribological design is proposed, which is to perform parallel computing using the multitasking capability of today's operating system. In the concurrent computing a master program, which manages the process of the optimization, is used to launch a number of standalone slave programs (air bearing models) in a quick succession. And the operating system (MS-Windows) of the computer manages the parallel execution of the slave programs. Other than the standard programming language (Fortran 95) this approach uses none of the general parallel programming paradigms or directives, such as message passing interface, OpenMP, or coding using graphics processing units. In this study, the algorithm for the multiobjective optimization is group inching fortification method and the concurrent computing is executed in the algorithm-level.

To obtain real-time GNSS satellite orbit and clock, three approaches exist currently, namely, the prediction-estimation approach, the prediction-correction approach and the estimation approach. Different from the former two approaches, which are based on the predicted orbit, the last approach estimates orbit and clock in an integrated way, thus it is the most rigorous one. However, the simultaneously estimation of both orbit and clock parameters makes it very time-consuming. In this contribution, the extended Kalman filter with parallel computation proposed for real-time GPS satellite clock estimation (Gao et al., 2017) is introduced to improve the computational efficiency. In the introduced method, the epoch observations are processed sequentially and the covariance update process is accelerated with the Open Multi-Processing. With observation data from about 70 globally distributed stations spanning days 001–003 of 2018, the real-time GPS orbit and clock are estimated for validation. The epoch average processing time of the introduced method achieves around 2.9 s on average with 16 CPU cores, while that of the traditional method without Open Multi-Processing is about 4.1 s.

To protect malware, they use packers, which are (commercial) tools that contain various anti-reverse engineering techniques such as code encryption, anti-debugging, and code virtualization. In this paper, we present x64Unpack: a hybrid emulation scheme that makes it easier to analyze packed executable files and automatically unpacks them in 64-bit Windows environments. The most distinguishable feature of x64Unpack compared to other dynamic analysis tools is that x64Unpack and the target program share virtual memory to support both instruction emulation and direct execution. Emulation runs slow but provides detailed information, whereas direct execution of the code chunk runs very fast and can handle complex cases regarding to operating systems or hardware devices. With x64Unpack, we can monitor major API (Application Programming Interface) function calls or conduct fine-grained analysis at the instruction-level. Furthermore, x64Unpack can detect anti-debugging code chunks, dump memory, and unpack the packed files. To verify the effectiveness of x64Unpack, experiments were conducted on the obfuscation tools: UPX 3.95, MPRESS 2.19, Themida 2.4.6, and VMProtect 3.4. Especially, VMProtect and Themida are considered as some of the most complex commercial packers in 64-bit Windows environments. Experimental results show that x64Unpack correctly emulates the packed executable files and successfully produces the unpacked version. Based on this, we provide the detailed analysis results on the obfuscated executable file that was generated by VMProtect 3.4.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cryptography; Malware; Packers; Reverse engineering; Anti-reverse engineerings; Binary code analysis; Dynamic analysis tools; Executable files; Fine-grained analysis; Hardware devices; Instruction-level; Windows environment; Program debugging","Anti-forensics; code obfuscation; computer security; dynamic code analysis; reverse engineering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089529793"

This paper proposes an improved method based on morphology and profile analysis to extract bridges with removing background objects such as vegetation. To remove vegetation effectively, a new morphological three dimensional (3D) discrete points operator is applied which the gridding method is utilized to obtain the neighborhoods of the discrete points. Subsequently, union-find sets is incorporated with the profile analysis method to optimize the process of generating the minimum spanning tree (MST) and determining connected domains, which are used to remove large objects and leave the bridges behind. By combining the optimized profile analysis method with the topological characteristics of bridges, bridges are extracted without dependence on their shapes. Finally, in order to improve the computation efficiency of the Lidar data, the OpenMP is employed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extract the bridges from Lidar data effectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Data mining; Efficiency; Extraction; Morphology; Vegetation; Computation efficiency; Influence of vegetations; Light detection and ranging; OpenMP; Profile analysis; Three dimensional morphology; Threedimensional (3-d); Topological characteristics; Optical radar","Bridge extraction; OpenMP; Profile analysis; Three dimensional morphology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071978176"

A rapid and consistent methodology for extracting urban morphology information is urgently needed for sustainable urban development in global cities, particularly given future trends of rapid urbanization. However, there is still a lack of generally applicable methods that use open-source data in this context. In this study, we developed a simple and highly efficient method for acquiring 3D urban morphology information using open-source data. Building footprints were acquired from the Maps Static application programming interface. Building heights were extracted from an open digital surface model, i.e., the ALOS World 3D model with a resolution of 30 m (AW3D30). Thereafter, urban morphological parameters, including the sky view factor, building coverage ratio, building volume density, and frontal area density, were calculated based on the retrieved building footprints and building heights.

Modern PF applications have demanding accuracy and run-time constraints that can be addressed through parallel computing. However, an efficient parallelization of PFs can only be achieved by effectively parallelizing the bottleneck: Resampling and its constituent redistribution step. A pre-existing implementation of redistribute on Shared Memory Architectures (SMAs) achieves O(N T log2N) time complexity over T parallel cores. This redistribute implementation is, however, highly computationally intensive and cannot be effectively parallelized due to the inherently limited number of cores of SMAs. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel redistribute on OpenMP 4.5 which takes O(N T + log2N) steps and fully exploits the computational power of SMAs. The proposed approach is up to six times faster than the O(N T log2N) one and its implementation on GPU provides a further three-time speed-up vs its equivalent on a 32-core CPU.We also show on an exemplary PF that our redistribution is no longer the bottleneck.  © 2020 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Memory architecture; Monte Carlo methods; Passive filters; Computational power; Filtering problems; Non-linear non-Gaussian; Parallelizations; Particle filters (PFs); Sequential Monte Carlo methods; Shared memory architecture; Shared memory system; Gaussian noise (electronic)","OpenMP; Parallel particle filters; Redistribute; Resampling; Shared memory architectures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105551608"

Computational powers of these electronics enable actions that previously were possible only for computers. By the use of special applications, we may benefit from sensors and multimedia capabilities of operating systems. Therefore, a new era for devoted implementations opens, in which a smart application can take a role of computing system to estimate the symptoms of diseases by evaluating signals coming from a human body. Methods: We propose a model of an application implemented for mobile android systems, which can be used for examination of central nervous system motor disorders occurring in patients suffering from Huntington (HD), Alzheimer, or Parkinson diseases. In particular, the model tracks tremors (involuntary movements), and cognitive (memory loss or dementia) impairments using touch and visual stimulus modalities. The proposed model interprets the symptoms from human bodies that indicate one of the diseases of the nervous system. Pre-processing of collected data for feature extraction is executed on a mobile device by using core functionality and methods provided in android's application programming interface. The information is evaluated by a back-propagation neural network classifier and the result is presented to the end user. The system is able to contact medical supervision and provide an assistance from the clinic. Results: The system uses a collected dataset of 1928 records, taken from 11 HD patients and 11 healthy persons in Lithuania, to gather statistics about examinations and presents the results as medical evaluation with prediction on the state of health. The accuracy of recognition of early, prodromal symptoms for central nervous system motor disorders is 86.4% (F-measure 0.859). The app (available on Google Play) is easy to use and is efficient tool for decision support in medical examinations. Conclusions: The use of intelligent apps which can help to evaluate neurodegenerative disorders is an important enhancement to medical diagnosis. The developed smartphone app supports the doctor with additional results that are easy to compare with other examinations.

The sheer amount of code required to support such broad capabilities can make it a daunting task to adapt these tools to building neurorobotic systems for flight.

Therefore, alternative approaches are required. The effects of malware can be estimated by analyzing the opcodes in its executable files. It can then be classified into families using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Vectorizing opcodes and application programming interface (API) function names using one-hot encoding results in high-dimensional vectors because each case is represented using one dimension. Therefore, this paper proposes a word2vec-based LSTM method to analyze opcodes and API function names using fewer dimensions. The results of opcode and API function name classification using the proposed method and one-hot encoding were compared using the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset. The proposed method showed approximately 0.5% higher performance than the one-hot encoding-based approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Brain; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Deep learning; Encoding (symbols); Long short-term memory; Malware; Security of data; Signal encoding; State assignment; API functions; Executable files; High-dimensional; Malware classifications; Malware detection; MicroSoft; One dimension; Security; Static analysis","Deep learning; Malware classification; Security; Static analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068035946"

In the first stage, Taguchi method is utilized for design of experiments (DOE). Process parameters include mold temperature, melt temperature, flow rate, cooling time, and four parameters related to variable pressure profile. Quality characteristics of plastic product containing warpage, weld line, and clamp force are obtained by simulation experiments. ANOVA and S/N ratio are utilized for data analysis to identify the importance of factors, provide an initial optimal combination of process parameters, and obtain quantitative factor’s contribution percentage. The number of process parameters is compressed from 8 to 5 considering factors’ contribution percentage for reduction in time and computation cost. In the second stage, hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) are utilized as further study to search for optimal solutions for synchronous reduction in three quality characteristics within compressed design space. Orthogonal array with Latin hypercube sampling (OA-LHS) is adopted for sampling with uniformity and stratification. ANN is utilized as a surrogate model to fit the surface between parameters and quality characteristics. MOGA is adopted to search the optimal solutions along the Pareto frontier. With the help of python, visual basic scripts, application programming interface (API) of Moldflow and DAKOTA, the two-stage optimization process is automated, which allows designers to study optimization for PIM, accurately and efficiently, without deep understanding of complicated optimization algorithms.

The primary challenge of this system is to utilise an appropriate prediction model that can predict various space weather parameters as accurately as possible. In this study, an ionospheric IoT analytical system with variational mode decomposition (VMD) based on kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is proposed. The ionospheric signal delay/total electron content (TEC) data from Continuous Reference Stations (CORS) Port Blair (2.03°N, 165.25°E, geomagnetic), Bengaluru (4.40°N, 150.77°E, geomagnetic), Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation (KLEF) - Guntur (7.50°N, 153.76°E; geomagnetic) and Lucknow (17.98°N, 155.22°E; geomagnetic) are used for the analysis during the period of 2015. The ionospheric signal delays of four CORS are computed from ThingSpeak (IoT) with the channel ID and the Application Programming Interface key. ThingSpeak data is given to the ionospheric forecasting model (VMD-KELM). The results predicted from the proposed model are able to achieve the faster training process and obtain a similar accuracy to that of the VMD-artificial neural network. The proposed VMD-KELM application is adopted when a cloud-based forecasting system requires fast learning speed and good accuracy.

CPSs comprises mixed-critical tasks which are of either safety-critical (high) or non-safety critical (low). In traditional task scheduling, most of the existing scheduling algorithms provide poor performance for high-criticality tasks when the system experiences overload and do not show explicit separation among different criticality tasks to take advantage of using cloud resources. Here, we propose a framework to schedule the mixed-criticality tasks by analyzing their deadlines and execution times which leverage the performance of parallel processing through OpenMP. The proposed framework introduces a machine learning-based prediction for a task offloading in the cloud. Moreover, it illustrates to execute a selected number of low-criticality tasks in the cloud while the high-criticality tasks are run on the local processors during the system overload. As a result, the high-criticality tasks meet all their deadlines and the system achieves a significant improvement in the overall execution time and better throughput. In addition, the experimental results employing OpenMP show the effectiveness of using the partitioned scheduling over the global scheduling method upon multiprocessor systems to achieve the tasks isolation. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The proposed platform is a web-based application which acquires the load profile of the customer, associated flexible appliances, and the customer preferences for using the appliances. In turn, presents the optimal operation schedule for flexible appliances and attained benefits from using the optimal schedule. To calculate the optimal operation schedule, a mixed-integer linear optimization model is devised where the decision variables are settings of flexible appliances, charge/discharge status and amount of storage device, charge/discharge status, and amount of electrical vehicle. The devised optimization engine is linked to a database to acquire required data for optimization which encompasses historical data for customer load, forecasts of renewables, ratings of customers' flexible appliances, and subjected energy tariff. The attained optimal scheduling for the customer is then returned to the database. On the other hand, the database is linked to the web-based user interface to get the user preferences (write to the database) and represent the recommendation for optimal operation and attained benefits (read from database). To manage the links between web-based user interface, database, and optimization tool, proper linking application programming interfaces (APIs) are devised.

The method results in a multitude of solutions; our algorithm chooses the solution that fits the tool snug to the edge, resulting in a radiused corner with a radius matching the tool insert radius. A classification method is used to identify the region of the radiused corner and an algorithm is presented to generate tool path for machining it. The DSM was tested and verified by graphical simulations in a custom OpenGL based graphical CNC simulator, a custom simulator developed in Maple graphics™, and test pieces machined using five-axis DSM toolpaths are presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Classification methods; Cnc machining; Custom simulators; Five-axis machining; Graphical simulation; Multi-point machining; Point of contact; Tool positioning; Machine tools","Bézier surface; CNC machining; Five-axis machining; Multipoint machining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065523840"

The problem is challenging, as OpenFlow is one of the popular southbound application programming interfaces, which enables controller-switch interaction. The related existing literature addresses the different aspects of OpenFlow and SDN-controller interactions. However, there is a need to analyze the performance of the OpenFlow switch, in order to determine the bounds of the performance measures. In this paper, we propose Markov chain-based analytical model, named AMOPE, for analyzing packet flow through an OpenFlow switch, while defining the probabilistic bounds on performance analysis. Additionally, in AMOPE, we propose a state diagram based on the OpenFlow specification version 1.5.0, and calculate the theoretical probabilities of a packet to be in different states of the OpenFlow switch. Furthermore, AMOPE defines the theoretical bounds of OpenFlow performance measures such as the output action, packet drop, and send to the controller probabilities. Simulation-based analysis exhibits that approximately 60% of the processed packets are sent to output action, 31% of the processed packets are sent to the controller, and the remaining processed packets are dropped in an OpenFlow switch. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Controllers; Markov chains; Software defined networking; Openflow; Packet flows; Performance analysis; Performance measure; Performance Model; Probabilistic bounds; Simulation-based analysis; Theoretical bounds; Packet switching","Markov chain; OpenFlow; packet flow; performance modeling; software-defined networks (SDN)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081565211"

In the literature there are numerous feature selection methods, mRMR (minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance) being one of the most widely used. However, although it achieves good results in selecting relevant features, it is impractical for datasets with thousands of features. A possible solution to this limitation is the use of the fast-mRMR method, a greedy optimization of the mRMR algorithm that improves both scalability and efficiency. In this work we present fast-mRMR-MPI, a novel hybrid parallel implementation that uses MPI and OpenMP to accelerate feature selection on distributed-memory clusters. Our performance evaluation on two different systems using five representative input datasets shows that fast-mRMR-MPI is significantly faster than fast-mRMR while providing the same results. As an example, our tool needs less than one minute to select 200 features of a dataset with more than four million features and 16,000 samples on a cluster with 32 nodes (768 cores in total), while the sequential fast-mRMR required more than eight hours. Moreover, fast-mRMR-MPI distributes data so that it is able to exploit the memory available on different nodes of a cluster and then complete analyses that fail on a single node due to memory constraints.

To control the various network functions needed to meet the variety of requests, softwarization of all access system functions, including transmission functions, and open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been studied. As well as function changes, we aim at maximizing the merits of SDN by adaptively configuring network function parameters to meet individual application requirements. This paper proposes a novel access system architecture with configuration optimizer that adaptively generates parameter configuration values from application requirements, and adaptive configuration values for image transmission to enhance computation efficiency.

However, interoperability issues between wind, structural engineering tools, and BIM design authoring software platforms have acted as a barrier to such collaborative design processes. This research pursued an evaluation-based approach to propose and develop a workflow for resolving the interoperability issues as well as automating significant parts of the collaborative design process. In this paper, the development of an automated modelling system to facilitate integrated structural design and wind engineering analysis using BIM is presented. The research was focused on pre-engineered building (PEB) as a case study. This research introduces some novel BIM concepts to facilitate the implementation of automation in the model development processes. These concepts facilitate engineering analysis integration and overcome challenges associated with creating and working with different level of development (LOD) models. The proposed system uses a central element level database and outputs a 3D model of the building and the computational domain for use by the computational fluid dynamics software. A BIM-based application program interface (API) and stand-alone software was developed to evaluate the proposed concepts and process and their feasibility. The results suggest a successful integration that could significantly improve the building design quality and further facilitate wind, or other, engineering design collaborations.

This feature and the existence of the SDN controller allow the developing of dynamic, adaptable and manageable networks, networks that require adequate services, and applications. However, the separation of these planes prevents the use of existing powerful tools that were coded considering traditional networks. In this paper, we make use of the potential of network virtualization (NV) technologies to propose the use of a virtualized infrastructure that makes possible the incorporation of these existing services and/or applications to an SDN network, without the need for programming additional and complex software modules in the SDN controller. Thus, in this paper, NV is not employed to develop a network managed by SDN but to broaden and give support to the SDN control layer. As an example, we describe the incorporation of nmap (a versatile and powerful tool widely used by security experts for network exploration) into the SDN framework. It is only necessary to develop a simple control plane service that thanks to the proposed virtualized infrastructure allows the inclusion of this powerful management application.

Many decomposition algorithms rely on reducing the search space in the routing space and applying heuristics algorithm in the spectrum assignment sub-problem. This is not necessarily a right solution as the ignored routing tables may lead to a better solution when they are used later as input to the Spectrum Assignment sub-problem. In this paper, we develop a new recursive decomposition approach for the RSA problem in optical networks. At the core of our approach is a new recursive branch and-bound procedure for carrying out an exhaustive search of the routing space in a scalable manner. This recursion effectively decouples the routing from the spectrum assignment part of the problem. Sequential generation of the full set of routing tables requires huge memory and very large processing time. Alternatively, our approach deploys multi-core architectures to generate the routing tables in parallel using OpenMP. Experimental results indicate that our recursive algorithm is quite efficient in searching the entire routing space for topologies representing large-scale wide area networks. Importantly, the decomposition may be more generally applied to any network design problem whose solution involves a search over both a routing and a resource allocation space. The main contributions for this paper are that we are able to generate all the search space in parallel in less than 1 min for 32-nodes network. Secondly, we are able to investigate all the routing tables, eliminate most of the search space, and select the promising routing tables that are proven to lead to a better solution in the Spectrum Assignment Sub-Problem © 2019 Ain Shams University","Application programming interfaces (API); Combinatorial optimization; Computer architecture; Routing algorithms; Decomposition algorithm; Exhaustive routing search; Multicore architectures; Network design problems; Recursive decomposition; Routing and spectrum assignment (RSA); Routing and spectrum assignments; Sequential generation; Wide area networks","Exhaustive routing search; RSA; RSA decomposition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074483980"

However, the current permission-based sensor management systems of smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any App can get access to other sensors by just accessing the generic sensor Application Programming Interface (API). In this way, attackers can exploit these sensors in numerous ways: they can extract or leak users' sensitive information, transfer malware, or record or steal sensitive information from other nearby devices. In this paper, we propose 6thSense, a context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart devices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of sensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine Learning-based detection mechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT). We implemented 6thSense on several sensor-rich Android-based smart devices (i.e., smart watch and smartphone) and collected data from typical daily activities of 100 real users. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 6thSense against three sensor-based threats: (1) a malicious App that can be triggered via a sensor, (2) a malicious App that can leak information via a sensor, and (3) a malicious App that can steal data using sensors. Our extensive evaluations show that the 6thSense framework is an effective and practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an accuracy above 96 percent without compromising the normal functionality of the device.

However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK's Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK. © 2019 IEEE.","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Data flow analysis; Detectors; Diseases; Feature extraction; Flow graphs; Learning systems; Machine learning; Malware; Perturbation techniques; Semantics; Tools; Android malware; Automatic Detection; Control flow graphs; Human intervention; Machine learning models; Optimal perturbation; Perturbation method; Syntactic features; Mobile security","adversarial machine learning; Android malware detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070357934"

However, several researchers have argued that Java can be an excellent alternative for writing HPC applications. To gauge the comparative performance of Java parallel platforms, a benchmark study is required considering some real HPC applications.

However, there are not, currently, sufficient research studies on the safety analysis of the deep foundation pit in water-rich soft soils. As a result, dynamic predictions of the safety risk during the whole construction process are inadequate due to the lack of research studies. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for the construction safety of the deep foundation pit in water-rich soft soils, which combines the building information modeling (BIM), the finite element analysis (FEA), and the finite difference method (FDM). By using BIM technology, the author attempts to establish a 3D information model and a bracing structure model. Based on the application programming interface and the C# language, the data conversion from BIM-ANSYS-FLAC3D is realized. The author then attempts to analyze the ground surface settlement and horizontal displacement during the excavation of the deep foundation pit through FLAC3D, and the purpose of which is to identify potential safety hazards so that reasonable control measures can be taken. The approach presented in this article has been validated in the Project of Qinhuai River Ship Lock. Since the excavation and the after-construction stages of this project have been completed smoothly, this approach has been proved valid and applicable.  © 2020 Huier Xu and Shoude Li.","3D modeling; Application programming interfaces (API); Data handling; Excavation; Finite difference method; Foundations; Information theory; Safety engineering; Soils; 3d information models; Building Information Model - BIM; Complicated geological conditions; Construction process; Finitedifference methods (FDM); Ground surface settlements; Horizontal displacements; Potential safety hazards; Architectural design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094883427"

A modular approach facilitates connecting to existing cloud backend servers and managing message formats and APIs’ native application logic to meet the communication constraints of resource-limited end devices. We investigated options for positioning the LDAF server in fog computing architectures. We demonstrated the approach in three use cases: (i) a simple domain name system (DNS) query from the device to a DNS server, (ii) a complex interaction of a blockchain—based IoT device with a blockchain network, and (iii) difference based patching of binary (system) files at the IoT end devices. In a blockchain smart meter use case we effectively enabled decentralized applications (DApp) for devices that without our solution could not participate in a blockchain network. Employing the more efficient binary content encoding, we reduced the periodic traffic from 16 kB/s to ~1.1 kB/s, i.e., 7% of the initial traffic. With additional optimization of the application protocol in the gateway and message filtering, the periodic traffic was reduced to ~1% of the initial traffic, without any tradeoffs in the application’s functionality or security. Using a function of binary difference we managed to reduce the size of the communication traffic to the end device, at least when the binary patch was smaller than the patching file. © 2019 by the authors.

The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs). © 2019 by the authors.

However, the difficulties involved in learning and making of distinct gestures affect the performance of an interactive system. By incorporating computer vision in Virtual Reality (VR), this paper presents an intuitive interaction technique where the states and positions of eyes are traced for interaction. With comparatively low cognitive load, the technique offers an easy to use interaction solution for VR applications. Unlike other gestural interfaces, interactions are performed in distinct phases where transition from one phase to another is enacted with simple blink of eyes. In an attained phase, interaction along an arbitrary axis is performed by a perceptive gesture of head; rolling, pitching or yawing. To follow the trajectory of eyes in real time, coordinates mapping is performed dynamically. The proposed technique is implemented in a case-study project; EBI (Eyes Blinking based Interaction). In the EBI project, real time detection and tracking of eyes are performed at the back-end. At the front-end, virtual scene is rendered accordingly by using the OpenGL library. To assess accuracy, usability and cognitive load of the proposed technique, the EBI project is evaluated 280 times in three different evaluation sessions. With an ordinary camera, an average accuracy of 81.4% is achieved. However, assessment made by using a high-quality camera revealed that accuracy of the system could be raised to a higher level. As a whole, findings of the evaluations support applicability of the technique in the emerging domains of VR. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cameras; Virtual reality; 3D interactions; Eyes recognition; Gestural interfaces; Gesture-based interface; Head gestures; Interaction techniques; Intuitive interaction; Real time detection and tracking; Digital libraries","3D interactions; Eyes recognition; Head gestures for interaction; Virtual environment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074726355"

However, there are relatively few studies on the parallel overhead in the power system research field at present. In this paper, the geneses of the parallel overhead are introduced from the point of view of computer technology. The composition of the parallel overhead of the bordered block diagonal form (BBDF) method and the nested BBDF (NBBDF) method of the power system parallel TSS is analyzed. The time consumption of computing tasks and the parallel overhead of the BBDF method and the NBBDF method implemented by message passing interface (MPI) and OpenMP under different thread scheduling patterns are tested in detail in the 2383wp system and two practical power systems (13 490 node and 24 886 node). On this basis, an efficient implementation of the NBBDF method based on subnet-core mapping and mixed programming of MPI and OpenMP is suggested, which can further reduce the parallel overhead and increase the speedup ratio to more than 17x with 64 cores in the 24 886-node system.

Three ANN algorithms were trained on a knowledge base to identify optimal AM processes for different part designs. A two-stage model was used to enhance the prediction accuracy above 90% by increasing the number of input factors and datasets. A cyber interface was developed to query AM machine availability and resource capability using a Node-RED IoT device simulator.

However, the application of co-modality as a measure of evaluating public transit system performance is recent and has been predominantly used in freight transport systems. This study proposes a novel approach by using co-modality as a key performance indicator to characterize public transit systems for passengers. This paper examines a new data set to evaluate transit systems from a user perspective. The data is gathered from an Application Programming Interface (API) which pulls from the real-time General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). Data was collected over 24 h to explore 4320 transit trips and 69,120 attributes for a single origin–destination pair. Co-modality is used to understand how dozens of transit routes and schedules will best serve transit users. A detailed analysis of trips involving multiple transit segments is conducted to understand how varying headways influence the overall trip travel time. The main conclusion for this paper is that a user perspective is necessary to understand co-modality across public transit systems. Some of the metrics identified in this paper, such as percent of trip spent walking, will be useful in assessing last-mile portions of travel across multiple trips. A better understanding of transit service to travelers by the transit system as a whole will help to improve transportation in dense urban areas. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Freight transportation; Motor transportation; Rapid transit; Traffic control; Travel time; Dense urban areas; Freight transport systems; Key performance indicators; Public transit systems; Sustainable utilization; Transportation mode; Urban transit system; User perspectives; Urban transportation","API; Co-modality; GTFS; Performance; Public transit; Travel time","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083772720"

They can be effective tools to understand what happens and when and where it happens, either retrospectively or in real time. Correspondingly, a variety of approaches have been proposed for detecting either targeted or general events. However, neither type of event detection technique has been developed to detect urban emergencies that happen in specific geographic locations and with unpredictable characteristics. Therefore, we propose a spatial and data-driven detecting urban emergencies technique (DUET) for natural hazards, manmade disasters, and other emergencies. The method addresses both geographic and semantic dimensions of events using a geotopic detection module and evaluates their crisis levels on the basis of the intensity of negative sentiment through a ranking module. DUET was designed specifically for georeferenced tweets from a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API). To validate the technique, we conducted multiple experiments with geotagged tweets in different urban environments over a period of four to six consecutive hours. DUET successfully identified emergencies of different types among all the candidate geotopics. Our future work focuses on enabling online-mode detection with high scalability with large volumes of streaming data and providing interactive visualization through a GIS system. DUET can identify emergencies of general types and provide timely emergency reports both to first responders and to the public.

BIPES is an open source software and service that is freely available through the website http://www.bipes.net.br and has been conceived from our experience of several years developing embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and teaching. It allows anyone to quickly and reliably design, program, build, deploy and monitor embedded systems, IoT devices and applications using blocks or Python based programming. It is fully based on web environment, so absolutely no software installation is needed on the client developer machine. In this way, a tablet, a netbook, a Chromebook or any other device can be used to program and test several types of devices. Mainly, it relies on MicroPython or CircuitPython, WebREPL, WebSockets, Web Serial API, HTML, JavaScript and Google Blockly to allow no-code programming (blocks) to be translated into Python code and then deployed to the target board. Moreover, it does not require server side processing, so it can be deployed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), allowing it to be used even when the computer is offline. It is compatible with several low cost boards such as: mBed, BBC micro:bit, ESP8266, ESP32 and Raspberry Pi using only a web browser and without the need to install any software on the device where the user develops the programming. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, a deep understanding of such fine flow phenomena poses a great challenge for turbulent methods and computer resources. In order to clarify the impacts of incoming flow states on the three-dimensional transitional flow in a compressor cascade, we construct a parallel Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) methodology and apply it to a full-span compressor cascade. Both the turbulent and laminar incoming endwall boundary layers are considered at a free-stream turbulence level of 4%, which is typical in the multistage axial-flow compressor environment. The parallel performance of the MPI (Message Passing Interface) model and hybrid MPI-OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) model is particularly analyzed at a parallel scale of 10 000 CPU (Central Processing Unit) cores. The parallel performance test shows that the efficiency of the MPI model is evidently higher than that of the hybrid MPI-OpenMP model. The LES results indicate that the incoming laminar endwall boundary layer results in a more remarkable reduction in the blade loading near the endwall and a larger total pressure loss than the turbulent one. The incoming endwall boundary layer state shows a significant impact on the evolution process of the endwall turbulence and a small impact on the corner separation and the suction-surface transition. This study demonstrates the ability of the parallel LES method to capture complex transitional-flow structures in compressor cascades and its potential application to the deeper understandings of compressor aerodynamics. © 2019 Author(s).","Aerodynamics; Application programming interfaces (API); Atmospheric thermodynamics; Cascades (fluid mechanics); Laminar boundary layer; Large eddy simulation; Message passing; Program processors; Transition flow; Turbulence; Computer resources; End-wall boundary layers; External disturbances; Freestream turbulence; Laminar turbulent transitions; Message passing interface; Parallel performance; Total-pressure loss; Axial-flow compressors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074991470"

However, the performance issues of the IB-LBM have to be considered when simulating the practical problems. The Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) from NVIDIA offer a possible solution for the parallel computing, while the CPU is a multicore processor that can also improve the parallel performance. This paper proposes a parallel algorithm for IB-LBM on a CPU-GPU heterogeneous platform, in which the CPU not only controls the launch of the kernel function but also performs calculations. According to the relatively local calculation characteristics of IB-LBM and the features of the heterogeneous platform, the flow field is divided into two parts: GPU computing domain and CPU computing domain. CUDA and OpenMP are used for parallel computing on the two computing domains, respectively. Since the calculation time is less than the data transmission time, a buffer is set at the junction of two computational domains. The size of the buffer determines the number of the evolution of the flow field before the data exchange. Therefore, the number of communications can be reduced by increasing buffer size. The performance of the method was investigated and analyzed using the traditional metric MFLUPS. The new algorithm is applied to the computational simulation of red blood cells (RBCs) in Poiseuille flow and through a microchannel.  © 2020 Zhixiang Liu et al.","Application programming interfaces (API); Blood; Computer graphics; Electronic data interchange; Flow fields; Graphics processing unit; Kinetic theory; Program processors; Calculation characteristics; Computational domains; Computational simulation; Data transmission time; Heterogeneous platforms; Lattice Boltzmann method; Multi-core processor; Parallel performance; Fluid structure interaction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093095475"

However, the rapidly increasing number of APIs makes it difficult to choose suitable APIs for a mashup, especially when the historical relationships between APIs and mashups are very sparse. Many researchers have sought to develop algorithms to recommend APIs to mashups. Some hybrid approaches integrate model-based collaborative filtering and auxiliary information and have achieved good prediction performance. However, there are few models that analyze the contextual information of services' descriptions. In addition, many approaches explore the context information of APIs, but few of them consider the context information of mashups. This paper presents a new model named CDHMF for recommender systems, which uses the Word2Vec technique to integrate the contextual information into a probabilistic factorization matrix (PMF).

One of the frequently used methods is limiting the flow velocity to a so-called “erosional velocity”, below which it is assumed that no erosion-corrosion would occur. Over the last 40 years, the American Petroleum Institute recommended practice 14E (API RP 14E) equation has been used by many operators to estimate the erosional velocity. The API RP 14E equation has become popular because it is simple to apply and requires little in the way of inputs. However, due to a lack of alternatives and its simplicity, the API RP 14E equation has been frequently misused by it being applied to conditions where it is invalid, by simply adjusting the empirical c-factor. Even when used within the specified conditions and associated applications, the API RP 14E equation has some limitations, such as not providing any quantitative guidelines for estimating the erosional velocity in the two most common scenarios found in the field: when solid particles are present in the production fluids and when erosion and corrosion are both involved. A range of alternatives to the API RP 14E equation that are available in the open literature is presented. Some of these alternatives overlap with API RP 14E, while others go beyond its narrow application range, particularly when it comes to erosion by solid particles. A comparison between the experimentally obtained and calculated erosion by different models is presented. The erosional velocity calculated by some of the models was compared with that estimated by the API RP 14E equation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Flow velocity; Gas industry; Public utilities; Steel corrosion; Underground corrosion; Underground equipment; Velocity; American Petroleum Institute; API RP 14E; Erosion - corrosions; Geological reservoirs; Oil and gas companies; Recommended practice; Sand erosion; Velocity limit; Erosion","API RP 14E; Erosion; Erosion-corrosion; Erosional velocity; Sand erosion; Velocity limit","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063761945"

Ideally, APIs should have some characteristics, for example, they should be well documented and stable so that client systems can confidently rely on them. However, not all APIs are equal in number of clients: while some APIs are very popular and used worldwide, other may face much lower usage rates. In this context, one question appears: are there particular characteristics that differentiate popular APIs from ordinary APIs? Answering this question can uncover how worldwide APIs are actually implemented and maintained, revealing practices to better support both research and development on APIs. In this paper, we assess the characteristics of popular APIs, including their size, legibility, documentation, stability, and client adoption. We analyze 1491 APIs provided by Java, Android, and 165 libraries. We detect that popular APIs are distinct from ordinary ones, for example, often, popular APIs are larger, have more comments, and are more unstable than ordinary APIs.

We present a novel method for further improving the recognition accuracy based on multiple cognitive APIs and four modules, fork integration, majority voting, score voting, and range voting. © 2020 by the authors.

Rapidly decreasing DNA synthesis service prices and the concomitant increase of research and development scales bolstered by computer-aided DNA design tools and laboratory automation has driven up the demand for synthetic DNA. While vendors provide user-friendly online portals for purchasing synthetic DNA, customers still face the time-consuming task of checking each vendor of choice for their ability and pricing to synthesize the desired sequences. As a result, ordering large batches of DNA sequences can be a laborious manual procedure in an otherwise increasingly automatable workflow. Even when they are available, there is a high degree of technical knowledge and effort required to integrate vendors’ application programming interfaces (APIs) into computer-aided DNA design tools or automated lab processes. Here, we introduce DNA Scanner, a software package comprising (i) a web-based user interface enabling users to compare the feasibility, price and turnaround time of synthetic DNA sequences across selected vendors and (ii) a Python API enabling integration of these functionalities into computer-aided DNA design tools and automated lab processes. We have developed DNA Scanner to uniformly streamline interactions between synthetic DNA vendors, members of the Global Biofoundry Alliance and the scientific community at large. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

FFS is always recommended to be measured at site, and this poses a problem of time, cost, effort, risk, and associated logistics. This paper presents a new approach for estimating the FFS by making use of the Application Programming Interface (API) for Google Maps. In particular, the proposed approach utilizes free travel times (FTT) obtained through Google Maps API (GMAPI). Data from GMAPI were compared with similar data collected using Moving Car/GPS on major roads in Greater Cairo in Egypt. Roads were divided into distinct segments considering the minimum length of segment on each road. All data were collected during free traffic flow conditions. Comparison and statistical tests of paired two samples confirmed the high accuracy of FTT and FFS values obtained from GMAPI. Three applications were presented in this paper utilizing the estimated FFS values. First, the legal speed limit was evaluated against the free-flow speed, and odd segments were identified for further actions. Second, sharp curves on a major road were evaluated for design consistency and results confirmed the possibility of improving safety conditions on such road. Third, FTT and FFS values obtained from GMAPI were utilized in developing the transportation model for a medium-size city in Egypt, especially in coding and validating the road network. The network validation results ensured that FTT and FFS values obtained from GMAPI can lead to robust transportation models. The general findings of this research promise more applications of Google Maps API in various traffic applications. © 2020, Gioacchino Onorati Editore.

In this work ETWV was assessed in different land covers, land uses and soil properties using FLUXNET data and climate reanalysis datasets available in Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE application programming interface (API), a powerful programming tool for non-experienced user, was used here to derived global ETWV maps. ETWV, computed with in situ FLUXNET data resulted in an overall ubRMSE of about 1.58 mm d−1. The ETWV estimates with GEE datasets yielded RMSE at least 56% smaller than those published by the available weather datasets.

However, OpenFlow, the de facto standard API for communicating with the switches, has limited visibility into the network headers, hindering innovations in the data plane and overloading the controller when a more sophisticated network application is needed. In this work, we leverage existing capabilities of modern switches to increase the abstraction power of OpenFlow and enrich the functionalities performed on the data plane of a network. We present an architecture that extends OpenFlow to support matching rules with domain names and provides data-plane operations that are only supported by the controller in existing approaches. Our architecture provides a better abstraction for programming the network and enables more concise policy specifications by requiring fewer rules in the switch flow table. To realize our architecture, we developed a prototype of a switch and a controller to handle the domain name extensions. We presented an application use case for blocking unwanted traffic required for Telecom companies. Our experimental results show that our solution reduces latency, number of rules in the switch, and number of packets sent to the controller. We also show that the new abstraction we provide can significantly reduce the code size of a network application. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer networks; Controllers; Software defined networking; De facto standard; Limited visibility; Network applications; Openflow; Policy specification; Software defined networking (SDN); Telecom; Unwanted traffic; Network architecture","Computer networks; DNS; OpenFlow; Software-defined networking; Telecom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075903650"

Worse, as demonstrated by the numerous leaks reported each week, the organizations that store and process them fail to adequately safeguard the required confidentiality. In this paper, we propose pdguard, a framework that defines prototypes and demonstrates an architecture and an implementation that address both problems. In the context of pdguard, personal data are always stored encrypted as opaque objects. Processing them can only be performed through the pdguard application programming interface (api), under data and action-specific authorizations supplied online by third party agents. Through these agents, end-users can easily and reliably authorize and audit how organizations use their personal data. A static verifier can be employed to identify accidental api misuses. Following a security by design approach, pdguard changes the problem of personal data management from the, apparently, intractable problem of supervising processes, operations, personnel, and a large software stack to that of auditing the applications that use the framework for compliance. We demonstrate the framework’s applicability through a reference implementation, by building a pdguard-based e-shop, and by integrating pdguard into the The Guardian newspaper’s website identity application. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Cryptography; Data privacy; Human resource management; Information management; Software architecture; Auditing; Design approaches; Encrypted data; Guardian newspapers; Opaque objects; Reference implementation; Software stacks; Third parties; Data handling","Auditing; Encrypted data; Personal data; Software architecture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073973286"

While in the long-term they are very useful to developers, many modern APIs have an incredibly steep learning curve, due to their hundreds of functions handling many arguments, obscure documentation, and frequently changing semantics. For APIs that perform data transformations, novices can often provide an I/O example demonstrating the desired transformation, but may be stuck on how to translate it to the API. A programming-by-example synthesis engine that takes such I/O examples and directly produces programs in the target API could help such novices. Such an engine presents unique challenges due to the breadth of real-world APIs, and the often-complex constraints over function arguments. We present a generator-based synthesis approach to contend with these problems. This approach uses a program candidate generator, which encodes basic constraints on the space of programs. We introduce neural-backed operators which can be seamlessly integrated into the program generator. To improve the efficiency of the search, we simply use these operators at non-deterministic decision points, instead of relying on domain-specific heuristics. We implement this technique for the Python pandas library in AutoPandas. AutoPandas supports 119 pandas dataframe transformation functions. We evaluate AutoPandas on 26 real-world benchmarks and find it solves 17 of them. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

In this study, a chatbot service was developed for the Covenant University Doctor (CUDoctor) telehealth system based on fuzzy logic rules and fuzzy inference. The service focuses on assessing the symptoms of tropical diseases in Nigeria. Telegram Bot Application Programming Interface (API) was used to create the interconnection between the chatbot and the system, while Twilio API was used for interconnectivity between the system and a short messaging service (SMS) subscriber. The service uses the knowledge base consisting of known facts on diseases and symptoms acquired from medical ontologies. A fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) is used to effectively predict the disease based on the symptoms inputted. The inputs of the users are recognized by NLP and are forwarded to the CUDoctor for decision support. Finally, a notification message displaying the end of the diagnosis process is sent to the user. The result is a medical diagnosis system which provides a personalized diagnosis utilizing self-input from users to effectively diagnose diseases. The usability of the developed system was evaluated using the system usability scale (SUS), yielding a mean SUS score of 80.4, which indicates the overall positive evaluation.

It is decided that in tied-arch bridges ties, arch ribs, and bottom and top bracings are made of built-up box sections, whereas built-up I sections are utilized for floor beams and stringers. Bars are adopted for hangers. In the formulation of the optimization problem, design variables are selected as the cross sectional dimensions of steel plates not that of I and box sections. Design pools are prepared for steel plate sections in addition to the hanger bars so that the optimization algorithm can select appropriate steel plates, construct I and box built-up sections for members of 3-D tied-arch such that the weight of the bridge is minimized. In addition to design code requirements, geometrical constraints among its elements that are required for manufacturability of the bridge are also considered. The design process of tied-arch bridges differs from that of steel framed structures. It necessitates consideration of moving vehicle loads. Design optimization algorithms require the response of bridges under several design load arrangements and in the construction of influence lines.

Appl. Probab. 7, 83-122) as a model for repulsive (fermionic) particle distributions. But their recent popularization is largely due to their usefulness for encouraging diversity in the final stage of a recommender system (Kulesza & Taskar 2012 Found. Trends Mach. Learn. 5, 123-286). The standard sampling scheme for finite DPPs is a spectral decomposition followed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally pivoted Cholesky factorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable to Hermitian kernels and has an expensive set-up cost. Researchers Launay et al. 2018 (http://arxiv. org/abs/1802.08429); Chen & Zhang 2018 NeurIPS (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7805-fast-greedy-map-inference-for-determinantal-point-process-to-improve-recommendation-diversity.pdf) have begun to connect DPP sampling to LDLH factorizations as a means of avoiding the initial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed the spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number of kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size. This article proves that trivial modifications of LU and LDLH factorizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and Hermitian DPP kernels, respectively. Furthermore, it is experimentally shown that even dynamically scheduled, shared-memory parallelizations of high-performance dense and sparse-direct factorizations can be trivially modified to yield DPP sampling schemes with essentially identical performance.

APIs of larger systems tend to be large, complex and have reduced modularity and quality, which makes them cumbersome to comprehend and use. These challenges can be addressed by static API analysis that focuses on studying API code itself and deriving business entities and dependencies from operational signatures. However, existing techniques for static analysis of APIs face the challenges in deriving a sufficient coverage of business entity relationship types from implementation-oriented API operational signatures carrying limited semantic insights. The paper aims to address such problems by supporting static analysis techniques for APIs that improve their modularity. Our approach adopts an object-oriented paradigm where the concept of 'object' is exemplified by the notion of business entity. It systematically applies interface analysis methods and techniques for eliciting knowledge of business entities and their attributes, for deriving the temporal order of calling operations across multiple business entities, and for learning and extracting various ways of invoking a service via APIs. The approach is implemented as an open-source tool and applied to a group of widely-deployed services in practice for validation. The research contributes to identifying key aspects of both the structure and behaviour of APIs, which will lead to building a simplified but comprehensive interface (presentation) layer to assist service users in understanding complex and overloaded interfaces as well as to facilitate efficient and effective service integration. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer systems programming; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Semantics; Static analysis; Analysis techniques; Deployed services; Interface analysis; Object oriented paradigm; Open source tools; Operational signatures; Productive systems; Service integration; Application programming interfaces (API)","APIs; Application programming interfaces; business entity; service interface analysis; service interface synthesis; service variants; web services","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089522701"

In such a service environment, if a mobile application is vulnerable to security threats and exposed to malicious behavior, malware can spread to hundreds of millions of connected devices. In particular, it is important to isolate and respond quickly to malicious mobile code. This requires the prediction of malicious behavior. Currently, security risk assessment schemes based on the permission use the description of the application or user review, but these schemes mostly offer a subjective evaluation, which inevitably reduces accuracy. In this paper, we thus propose a scheme for assessing security risk of Android mobile applications by analyzing their application programming interfaces (APIs) using machine learning. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to extract the APIs from the execution code of the application with reverse engineering analysis, such that each API can be compared with the malicious API database built from the existing malware dataset. Instead of simply judging the applications as malicious or benign, our scheme shows their risk as a score. To do this quantitative evaluation, we use an ensemble of tree boosting machine learning algorithms. To prove the practicality of the proposed scheme, we experiment with a set of benign and malicious real world samples, and compare our results with existing schemes. Experimental results show better performance and accuracy than conventional schemes based on Naive Bayes and simple ensemble algorithms. Our proposed scheme is expected to significantly contribute in responding rapidly to ever-more-intelligent malware of the future. © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive boosting; Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Data Sharing; Forestry; Learning systems; Machine learning; Malware; Mobile computing; Engineering analysis; Malicious mobile codes; Malware detection; Quantitative evaluation; Security risk assessments; Subjective evaluations; User-centric service; XGBoost; Risk assessment","machine learning; Malware detection; risk assessment; XGBoost","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082296476"

We developed and prospectively validated a versatile platform (IRIS) for real-time ICU physiologic monitoring, clinical decision making, and caretaker notification. Methods: IRIS was implemented in the neurointensive care unit to stream multimodal time series data, including EEG, intracranial pressure (ICP), and brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2), from ICU monitors to an analysis server. IRIS was applied for 364 patients undergoing continuous EEG, 26 patients undergoing burst suppression monitoring, and four patients undergoing intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen monitoring. Custom algorithms were used to identify periods of elevated ICP, compute burst suppression ratios (BSRs), and detect faulty or disconnected EEG electrodes. Hospital staff were notified of clinically relevant events using our secure API to route alerts through a password-protected smartphone application. Results: Sustained increases in ICP and concordant decreases in PbtO2 were reliably detected using user-defined thresholds and alert throttling. BSR trends computed by the platform correlated highly with manual neurologist markings (r2 0.633-0.781; p < 0.0001). The platform identified EEG electrodes with poor signal quality with 95% positive predictive value, and reduced latency of technician response by 93%. Conclusion: This study validates a flexible real-time platform for monitoring and interpreting ICU data and notifying caretakers of actionable results, with potential to reduce the manual burden of continuous monitoring services on care providers. Significance: This work represents an important step toward facilitating translational medical data analytics to improve patient care and reduce health care costs. © 2013 IEEE.","Adult; Algorithms; Brain Chemistry; Critical Care; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electroencephalography; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Intracranial Pressure; Monitoring, Physiologic; Oximetry; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Application programming interfaces (API); Brain; Data Analytics; Data streams; Decision making; Electrodes; mHealth; Monitoring; Time series analysis; Tissue; Clinical decision making; Continuous monitoring; Intra-cranial pressure; Neuro-intensive care; Physiologic monitoring; Positive predictive values; Real-time platform; Smart-phone applications; adult; Article; auditory threshold; blood glucose monitoring; brain depth stimulation; clinical decision making; computer model; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; electroencephalography monitoring; female; health care cost; health care quality; human; intensive care unit; intracranial pressure; machine learning; major clinical study; male; neuromonitoring; neurophysiology; oxygenation; patient care; patient safety; predictive value; prospective study; signal noise ratio; signal processing; telemetry; time series analysis; tissue oxygenation; algorithm; brain chemistry; computer assisted diagnosis; intensive care; intensive care unit; oximetry; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; signal processing; Intensive care units","Automated data analysis; Continuous data monitoring; EEG; Intensive care unit; Multimodal data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089300740"

However, the heterogeneity of the languages used for OS models and of the program source code makes it difficult to compose these seemingly independent components and thus requires translation of one language into another, causing various issues in verification. To alleviate this problem, we propose a hybrid approach that composes formal OS models with application programs in an interaction model. Based on typical OS-application interaction behavior, our interaction model is a composition framework that connects an OS model to application programs as long as they share the same Application Program Interface (API). It provides seamless composition of two heterogeneous software artifacts by formulating source code annotations based on control-flow analysis and by synchronizing state transitions over API function calls to regulate the context switching of multitasking programs. A prototype implementation of the interaction model was applied to eight benchmark programs of the Erika OS and a control program with real-scale complexity from the automotive domain. It was shown that the framework supports systematic and effective verification of multitasking embedded software, which has not been possible using code-level model checking. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Embedded software; Embedded systems; Model checking; Multitasking; Program translators; Application program interfaces; Composition frameworks; Control flow analysis; Heterogeneous software; Independent components; Interaction behavior; Program source codes; Prototype implementations; Application programs","Embedded software; heterogeneous composition; model checking; multi-tasking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089308107"

However, the security supports in the MQTT are very weak. In this paper, we systematically examine the security requirements of a MQTT-based IoT system, identify the gap between the requirements and the supported functions, and design a security-enhanced MQTT framework. The framework facilitates device authentication, key agreement, and policy authorisation. Additionally, it is desirable that any MQTT-security enhancements should be compatible with existent MQTT Application Programming Interfaces (API). We propose a two-phase authentication approach that can smoothly integrate secure key agreement schemes with the current MQTT-API. To evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency, we implement prototype. Compared to its counterparts, the results show the merits of improved communication performance, MQTT-API compliance, and security robustness.

Communication with the front-end hardware is handled by the proprietary gigabit optical serial interface protocol. A trigger module trigger for pexor extends the PEXOR by additional signal connections for triggered DAQ. For several years, the PEXOR boards have been used with the DAQ framework multibranch system (MBS). On a Linux x-86 platform, the device driver software mbspex implements concurrent access to the PEXOR front ends from MBS DAQ and from separate control applications, such as the command line tool gosipcmd or hardware specific configuration graphical user interfaces. Besides the established character driver mbspex, a network driver pexornet has been developed to evaluate a lightweight DAQ system with readout from PEXOR via a user datagram protocol (UDP) socket. Therefore, common network tools can be applied for driver configuration and data debugging. Moreover, the gosipcmd tool and its adjusted application programming interface library are fully applicable also for pexornet. A simple example DAQ application with pexornet UDP readout has been implemented with the software framework DAQ backbone core (DABC), delivering the same data file format and online monitoring capabilities as MBS.

In addition, the corresponding computational programs are compiled. First, from the perspective of the method, a meshing principle for discrete element models is determined, a treatment for material nonlinearity and strain rate effect is proposed, and a damping model is established. Next, the Displacement Method is introduced to determine the multi-support excitation for the MDEM, and then motion equations of particles under multi-support excitation are derived. On this basis, the specific process of gravitational field loading is presented. Furthermore, parallel implementation strategies for the MDEM based on OpenMP are constructed. Finally, the collapse simulation of a 1/3.5-scaled single-layer reticulated dome shaking table test model under multi-support excitation is carried out. The comparison demonstrates that the ultimate load and failure mode as well as the complete collapse time of the numerical results are consistent with the experimentally measured responses, and the configuration variations from member buckling and local depression until collapse failure are fully captured. Moreover, the displacement time-history curves obtained using MDEM are almost identical to the experimental measurements, and there is a nuance only in the amplitude. It is verified that MDEM is capable of precisely addressing the collapse failure for large-span spatial steel structures. Additionally, the failure mechanism for structures of this type is naturally revealed. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Application programming interfaces (API); Buckling; Domes; Dynamic response; Equations of motion; Steel structures; Strain rate; Structural dynamics; Multi-support excitation; Parallel Computation; Progressive collapse; Reticulated dome; Shaking table tests; Computational efficiency","Member Discrete Element Method; Multi-Support Excitation; Parallel Computation; Progressive Collapse Simulation; Shaking Table Test; Single-Layer Reticulated Dome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021227719"

This paper proposes a methodology for quantifying the impact of the error generated by the weather forecast in the building's indoor climate conditions and energy demand. The objective is to estimate the error introduced by the weather forecast in the load forecasting to have more precise predicted data. The methodology employed site-specific, near-future forecast weather data obtained through online open access Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The weather forecast providers supply forecasts up to 10 days ahead of key weather parameters such as outdoor temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction. This approach uses calibrated EnergyPlus models to foresee the errors in the indoor thermal behavior and energy demand caused by the increasing day-ahead weather forecasts. A case study investigated the impact of using up to 7-day weather forecasts on mean indoor temperature and energy demand predictions in a building located in Pamplona, Spain. The main novel concepts in this paper are: first, the characterization of the weather forecast error for a specific weather data provider and location and its effect in the building's load prediction. The error is calculated based on recorded hourly data so the results are provided on an hourly basis, avoiding the cancel out effect when a wider period of time is analyzed. The second is the classification and analysis of the data hour-by-hour to provide an estimate error for each hour of the day generating a map of hourly errors. This application becomes necessary when the building takes part in the day-ahead programs such as demand response or flexibility strategies, where the predicted hourly load must be provided to the grid in advance. The methodology developed in this paper can be extrapolated to any weather forecast provider, location or building. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In this work, GPS receiver covers outdoor location tracking, while active RFID provides identification and Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) reading for each tag holder to cover indoor location tracking especially near or inside building where location information is not detected by GPS. Several experiments were conducted on three different RFID tags which were active RFID tag embedded with GPS and GSM (ERFIDG2), active RFID tag embedded with GPS (ERFIDG) and standalone RFID tag communicating with the same active RFID reader. The experiment was done to evaluate the communication performance of the active RFID in terms of tags collection time using Transparent (AT) and Application Programming Interface (API) mode. The experiment was extended to measure tags collection time in single hop and multi hops communication for Tag Talk First (TTF) and Reader Talk First (RTF) protocols. The results show that the proposed active RFID system (ERFIDG2) is better than the standalone and ERFIDG systems.

Although there are many frameworks focusing on training neural networks, there are few that focus on high performance inference and visualization of medical images. Neural network inference requires an inference engine (IE), and there are currently several IEs available including Intel's OpenVINO, NVIDIA's TensorRT, and Google's TensorFlow which supports multiple backends, including NVIDIA's cuDNN, AMD's ROCm and Intel's MKL-DNN. These IEs only work on specific processors and have completely different application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we presents methods for extending FAST, an open-source high performance framework for medical imaging, to use any IE with a common programming interface. Thereby making it easier for users to deploy and test their neural networks on different processors. This article provides an overview of current IEs and how they can be combined with existing software such as FAST. The methods are demonstrated and evaluated on three performance demanding medical use cases: real-time ultrasound image segmentation, computed tomography (CT) volume segmentation, and patch-wise classification of whole slide microscopy images. Runtime performance was measured on the three use cases with several different IEs and processors. This revealed that the choice of IE and processor can affect performance of medical neural network image analysis considerably. In the most extreme case of processing 171 ultrasound frames, the difference between the fastest and slowest configuration were half a second vs. 24 seconds. For volume processing, using the CPU or the GPU, showed a difference of 2 vs. 53 seconds, and for processing an whole slide microscopy image, the difference was 81 seconds vs. almost 16 minutes.

The microstructural investigations of different zones including base metals, weld metal, heat-affected zones and interfaces were performed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties were measured by microhardness, tensile and impact tests. It was found that with increasing heat input, the dendrite size and inter-dendritic spacing in the weld metal increased. Also, the amount of delta ferrite in the weld metal was reduced. Therefore, tensile strength and hardness were reduced and impact test energy was increased. The investigation of the interface between AISI 316L base metal and ER316L filler metal showed that increasing the heat input increases the size of austenite grains in the fusion boundary.

Turkish Earthquake Code (2007) specifications are applied on optimum designs of steel space truss towers under the seismic loading for different local site classes depending on different soil groups. The proposed novel algorithm does not have any algorithm-specific control parameters and depends only a simple revision equation. Therefore, it provides a practical solution for structural optimization problems. Optimum solutions of the different steel truss examples are carried out by selecting suitable W sections taken from American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). In order to obtain optimum solutions, a computer program is coded in MATLAB in corporated with SAP2000-OAPI (Open Application Programming Interface). The stress and displacement constraints are applied on the design problems according to AISC-ASD (Allowable Stress Design) specifications. Firstly, a benchmark truss problem is examined to see the efficiency of Jaya optimization algorithm. Then, two different multi-element truss towers previously solved with other methods without seismic loading in literature are designed by the proposed algorithm. The first space tower is a 582-member space truss with the height of 80 m and the second space tower is a 942-member space truss of about 95 m height. The minimum optimum designs obtained with this novel algorithm for the case without seismic loading are lighter than the ones previously attained in the literature studies. The results obtained in the study show that Jaya algorithm is a practical and robust optimization method for structural optimization problems. Moreover, incorporation of the seismic loading causes significant increase in the minimum design weight.

Mainstream programming models for heterogeneous architectures, however, sacrifice safety and expressiveness in favor of low-level control over performance details. The interfaces between hardware units consist of verbose, unsafe APIs; hardware-specific languages make it difficult to move code between units; and brittle preprocessor macros complicate the task of specializing general code for efficient accelerated execution. We propose a unified low-level programming model for heterogeneous systems that offers control over performance, safe communication constructs, cross-device code portability, and hygienic metaprogramming for specialization. The language extends constructs from multi-stage programming to separate code for different hardware units, to communicate between them, and to express compile-time code optimization. We introduce static staging, a different take on multi-stage programming that lets the compiler generate all code and communication constructs ahead of time. To demonstrate our approach, we use static staging to implement BraidGL, a real-time graphics programming language for CPUsGPU systems. Current real-time graphics software in OpenGL uses stringly-typed APIs for communication and unsafe preprocessing to generate specialized GPU code variants. In BraidGL, programmers instead write hybrid CPUsGPU software in a unified language. The compiler statically generates target-specific code and guarantees safe communication between the CPU and the graphics pipeline stages.

Unlike the conventional ones, which use separate programming schemes for different processors of the machine, e.g., OpenMP for the CPU and CUDA for the GPU, the new ones tend to offer a unified programming model to abstract details of heterogeneous computing engines. One such programming model is Halide that is designed for high performance image processing. Halide programmers are allowed to map data and computation to either the CPUs or GPUs through high-level C++ functions, which are converted to various code targets, including x86, ARM, CUDA, and OpenCL, by the Halide compiler. Nevertheless, it becomes complex when the programmers attempt to write a Halide program for cooperative computation on both the CPU and GPU. In this work, we propose the synergistic computing framework that extends Halide to improve program execution performance. Several key issues are tackled, including data coherence, workload partitioning, job dispatching and communication/synchronization, so that the Halide programmers are allowed to take advantage of the heterogeneous computing engines with the two developed C++ classes, one is for static workload partitioning/dispatching and the other is the dynamic counterpart. Furthermore, optimizations are developed to improve performance by generating adequate the CPU code, and eliminating extra memory copies. We characterize and discuss the performance of two image processing programs and our framework on the heterogeneous platforms, i.e., Android Nexus 7 smartphone and x86-based computers. Our results show that significant performance gain can be achieved while the CPU and GPU execute a program synergistically with the proposed framework. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Application programming interfaces (API); Engines; Graphics processing unit; Image processing; Program compilers; Graphic processing units; Halide; Heterogeneous computing; Runtime systems; Synergistic computing; C++ (programming language)","Graphic processing units; Halide; Heterogeneous computing; Runtime system; Synergistic computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029574848"

A desire to quantify and compare both existing and emerging transportation options motivated development of the mobility energy productivity (MEP) metric described here. The MEP metric fundamentally measures the potential of a city’s transportation system to connect a person to a variety of services and activities that define a high quality of life, relative to the convenience, cost, and energy needed to provide these connections. Fundamentally derived from accessibility theory, the MEP advances practice by using readily available travel time data (either from web-based application programming interfaces or outputs from an urban transportation model) combined with established parameters that reflect the energy intensity and cost of various travel modes, and relative frequency of activity engagement. The construction of the MEP metric allows for aggregation and disaggregation to the appropriate spatial, modal, and trip purpose resolution, as analysis needs dictate.

This will be more comprehensible for the public and easier to cooperate with authorities in reducing the causes of air pollution. Since five pollutants contribute in determining the API values, API can be shown as a compositional data. This study is conducted based on the data of API and its pollutants collected from Klang city in Malaysia for the period of January 2005 to December 2014. The proportion of each pollutant in API is considered as a component with five components in a compositional API. The existence of zero components in some pollutants, that have no effect on API, is a serious problem that prevents the application of log-ratio transformation. Thus, the approach of amalgamation has been used to combine the components with zero in order to reduce the number of zeros. Also, a multiplicative replacement has been utilized to eliminate the zero components and replace them with a small value that maintains the ratios of nonzero components. Transforming the compositional data to log-ratio coordinates has been done using the additive log ratio transformation, and the transformed series is then modeled by using a VAR model. Four criteria are used to determine the number of lags p of VAR(p) and these are: the Akaike Information, the Schwartz, the Hannan–Quinn and the Final Prediction Error criteria. Based on the results, A VAR (1) model with no constants or trend is considered as the best fitted model and it is used to forecast 12 months ahead. In addition, API values are mainly determined by PM10 that has a proportion close to one most of the time during study period. Therefore, authorities and researchers need to study the sources of PM10 and provide the public with useful information and alternatives in term of reducing the air pollution. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Klang; Malaysia; Air pollution; Metadata; Metals; Time series analysis; Value engineering; Air pollution index; Amalgamation; Compositional API data; Compositional data; Final prediction errors; Log-ratio transformations; Multiplicative replacement; VAR models; air quality; atmospheric pollution; particulate matter; regression analysis; time series analysis; Application programming interfaces (API)","Additive log ratio; Amalgamation; Compositional API data; Multiplicative replacement; VAR model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046892641"

This paper introduces a navigation application programming interface (API), route fuel-saving evaluation framework for estimating fuel advantages of alternative API routes based on large-scale, real-world travel data for conventional vehicles (CVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Navigation APIs, such as Google Directions API, integrate traffic conditions and provide feasible alternative routes for origin-destination pairs. This paper develops two link-based fuelconsumption models stratified by link-level speed, road grade, and functional class (local/non-local), one for CVs and the other for HEVs. The link-based fuel-consumption models are built by assigning travel from many global positioning system driving traces to the links in TomTom MultiNet and road grade data from the U.S. Geological Survey elevation data set. Fuel consumption on a link is computed by the proposed model. This paper envisions two kinds of applications: (1) identifying alternate routes that save fuel, and (2) quantifying the potential fuel savings for large amounts of travel. An experiment based on a large-scale California Household Travel Survey global positioning system trajectory data set is conducted. The fuel consumption and savings of CVs and HEVs are investigated. At the same time, the trade-off between fuel saving and travel time due to choosing different routes is also examined for both powertrains. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.","Application programming interfaces (API); Economic and social effects; Fuel economy; Fuels; Global positioning system; Motor transportation; Navigation; Roads and streets; Transportation routes; Travel time; Evaluation framework; Feasible alternatives; Household travel surveys; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Routing strategies; Traffic conditions; Transportation system; U.s. geological surveys; Hybrid vehicles","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060907311"

A key challenge in compiler testing is the lack of an oracle that classifies an output as correct or incorrect; this is particularly pertinent in graphics shader compilers where the output is a rendered image that is typically underspecified. Our method builds on recent successful techniques for compiler validation based on metamorphic testing, and leverages existing high-value graphics shaders to create sets of transformed shaders that should be semantically equivalent. Rendering mismatches are then indicative of shader compilation bugs. Deviant shaders are automatically minimized to identify, in each case, a minimal change to an original high-value shader that induces a shader compiler bug. We have implemented the approach as a tool, GLFuzz, targeting the OpenGL shading language, GLSL. Our experiments over a set of 17 GPU and driver configurations, spanning the main 7 GPU designers, have led to us finding and reporting more than 60 distinct bugs, covering all tested configurations. As well as defective rendering, these issues identify security-critical vulnerabilities that affect WebGL, including a significant remote information leak security bug where a malicious web page can capture the contents of other browser tabs, and a bug whereby visiting a malicious web page can lead to a lblue screen of deathž under Windows 10.

Although different approaches have been proposed in program synthesis, only small or domain-specific programs can be generated in practice, the main obstacle of which lies in the intractability of program space. With the rapid growth of reusable libraries, component-based synthesis provides a promising way, such as synthesizing Java programs that are only composed of APIs. However, the efficiency of searching for proper solutions for complex tasks is still a challenge. In certain scenarios, some API methods are frequently called together. The usage of these API methods always follows some usage patterns. Incorporating the information about API usage patterns will help to accelerate the speed of program synthesis. However, state-of-The-Art synthesis tools do not capture the inherent relationships between API methods. Aiming at this problem, we propose a novel approach to accelerate the speed of API-based program synthesis via API usage pattern mining. It is a general approach that can be applied to any approach of API-based synthesis. We first collect open source projects of high quality from the Internet and use an off-The-shelf API-usage-pattern-mining tool to mine API usage patterns from these code snippets. We use two strategies to incorporate the information about API usage patterns with program synthesis, and either strategy can improve the efficiency of program synthesis. We evaluate our approach on 20 real programming tasks, which shows that our approach can accelerate the speed of program synthesis by 86% compared to the baseline. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Data mining; Efficiency; Open source software; Open systems; Petri nets; Component based; Open source projects; Program synthesis; Programming tasks; Proper solutions; Reusable library; State of the art; Usage patterns; Computer software reusability","API usage pattern mining; component-based synthesis; petri net; program synthesis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078280987"

Beams launched from a transmitter are recursively traced by applying the MADBT method and beam trees recorded the propagation path info are generated. By traversing the beam trees, all the valid propagation (transmitted, reflected and diffracted) paths are efficiently determined. Then the receiver power strength can be calculated based on geometrical optics (GO) and uniform theory of diffraction along the arrival paths. By tracing the continuous beams instead of a number of rays, the proposed method performs higher efficiency than the widely used ray tracing method. During the beam tracing procedure, several techniques are adopted to accelerate the calculation. Firstly, a localized kd-tree is built according to the coverage area of the transmitter, which is more efficient than the global kd-tree to do the beam-triangle intersection during the tracing procedure. Secondly, a virtual simulation face is generated to speed up the searching for ray paths. Lastly, the OpenMP and the MPI parallel technique are implemented to further enhance efficiency of the proposed method.

In this paper, a dynamic method is proposed for traffic engineering in software-defined data center networks helping to design an optimal demand-path mapping with a tolerable computational complexity. To achieve the aim of this study, we used a linear programming to define the problem statement and then modeled the problem as a Path-based multicommodity flow. To reduce time complexity, first, a decomposition technique is used to divide the problem model into smaller subproblems, which are then solved simultaneously by applying parallelizing techniques (ie, multiple-core computing and OpenMP). Next, a suitable iterative algorithm is utilized to quickly converge subproblem solutions leading to an answer to the master problem. Simulation results show that solving time is considerably improved compared with a number of reported schemes devoted to this topic. In addition, implementing the proposed method serially yields an optimum solution, which takes significantly shorter time to reach than that of the generic (the LP model that is not decomposed) approach.

We apply this to O(104) bubbles in a turbulent flow. This was accomplished by a well-considered combination of state-of-the-art numerical methods, as well as fast and scalable numerical algorithms that have their origin in single-phase and two-phase flows. The features key-elements of the algorithm of curvature computation, bubble collision and variable-coefficient Poisson equation solver are presented. Resolution requirements for an accurate advection of a rising bubble have been established by comparison with the (Hysing, 2009) benchmark. The Generalized Height Function (GHF) method, was adopted for the curvature computations. We observed agreement with theoretical convergence rates, as well as a significant reduction of spurious velocities when employing GHF, compared to a finite difference approach. The main interaction mechanisms between bubbles and walls of the domain were analyzed, showing second order convergence of the underlying numerical methods. A detailed analysis of the parallel performance of the Navier–Stokes (NS) solver and the solver for the gas volume fraction was carried out. The analysis revealed close to linear scaling up to ≈ 18000 cores on a computational grid with 1 billion cells for the NS solver, and an ideal scaling of the gas volume fraction solver up to O(103) bubbles. Beyond that, acceptable overhead for up to O(104) bubbles was found. A simulation of a downflow configuration of a turbulent channel loaded with a total of 10000 bubbles illustrates the computational capabilities. First and second order statistics of the velocity field were computed as well as the profiles of the average gas volume fraction field in the statistically steady state. In the case considered, a 47% increase of the wall shear stress was observed, brought about by turbulence modification arising from the embedded bubbles. The interaction between turbulence and bubbles at high volume fraction resulted in a strong attenuation of the rms of the velocity fluctuations in a wide region of the core of the channel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Channel flow; Convergence of numerical methods; Flowmeters; Poisson equation; Shear stress; Turbulence; Velocity; Volume fraction; Wall flow; Bubbly flow; Computational capability; Finite difference approach; openMP-MPI; Resolution requirements; Second order convergence; Statistically steady state; Turbulence modification; Two phase flow","Bubbly flow; Channel flow; DNS; openMP-MPI; VOF","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049525110"

Packet losses are high (>1%) in Android, Chrome, iOS, Opera, and Safari for DSL connection, but RTT values are low (<100 ms) in all different conditions excluding iOS. In the presented application, RTT and packet loss remain lower than 100 ms and 1%, respectively, in various scenarios, indicating good communication quality. RTT and packet loss are related to total time and hang time parameters, which describe the necessary time to establish and to end a call. It is shown that communication quality of the application can simply be measured by analyzing the total time parameter.

However, in spite of this importance, programming such systems is still challenging. In particular, it is challenging to map computations to the different processors of a heterogeneous device. In this paper, we provide a static analysis that mitigates this problem. Our contributions are two-fold: first, we provide a semi-context-sensitive algorithm, which analyzes the program’s call graph to determine the best processor for each calling context. This algorithm is parameterized by a cost model, which takes into consideration processor’s characteristics and data transfer time. Second, we show how to use simulated annealing to calibrate this cost model for a given heterogeneous architecture. We have used our ideas to build Etino, a tool that annotates C programs with OpenACC or OpenMP 4.0 directives. Etino generates code for a CPU-GPU architecture without user intervention. Experiments on classic benchmarks reveal speedups of up to 75x. Moreover, our calibration process lets Etino avoid slowdowns of up to 720x which trivial parallelization approaches would yield. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Application programming interfaces (API); C (programming language); Data transfer; Graph algorithms; Program processors; Simulated annealing; Calibration process; Compiler; Context sensitive; CPU-GPU architectures; GPUs; Heterogeneous architectures; Heterogeneous devices; User intervention; Static analysis","Compiler; GPUs; Heterogenous architecture; Static analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120102475"

In particular, solutions are needed in order to obtain a response for applications with real-time constraints. In the last decade, several efforts have been developed, many of them using graphics processing units (GPUs) and focused on the exploitation of spectral information alone. However, a few spectral unmixing chains have been developed using other architectures such as multicore processors, field programmable gate arrays, or Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors. In this letter, we develop a new parallel unmixing chain for multicore processors. Compared with other approaches, the proposed spatial-spectral alternative takes advantage of the complementary information provided by the spatial correlation of the pixels in the image in addition to the spectral information. Our implementation has been optimized using the application program interface OpenMP and the Intel Math Kernel Library on two multicore architectures, and using real analysis scenarios.

Many attempts have been made to implement well-known algorithms on embedded and mobile GPUs. Unfortunately, these applications are computationally complex and often require high precision arithmetic, whereas embedded and mobile GPUs are designed specifically for graphics, and thus are very restrictive in terms of input/output, precision, programming style and primitives available. This paper studies how to implement efficient and accurate high-precision algorithms on embedded GPUs adopting the OpenGL ES language. We discuss the problems arising during the design phase, and we detail our implementation choices, focusing on the SIFT and ALP key-point detectors. We transform standard, i.e., single (or double) precision floating-point computations, to reduced-precision GPU arithmetic without precision loss. We develop a desktop framework to simulate Gaussian Scale Space transforms on all possible target embedded GPU platforms, and with all possible range and precision arithmetic. We illustrate how to re-engineer standard Gaussian Scale Space computations to mobile multi-core parallel GPUs using the OpenGL ES language. We present experiments on a large set of standard images, proving how efficiency and accuracy can be maintained on different target platforms.

As APIs present the opportunity of increased productivity, it also calls for correct use to avoid buggy code. The usage-based specification mining technique has shown great promise in solving this problem through a data-driven approach. These techniques leverage the use of the API in large corpora to understand the recurring usages of the APIs and infer behavioral specifications (pre- and post-conditions) from such usages. A challenge for such technique is thus inference in the presence of insufficient usages, in terms of both frequency and richness. We refer to this as a “sparse usage problem."" This paper presents the first technique to solve the sparse usage problem in usage-based precondition mining. Our key insight is to leverage implicit beliefs to overcome sparse usage. An implicit belief (IB) is the knowledge implicitly derived from the fact about the code. An IB about a program is known implicitly to a programmer via the language’s constructs and semantics, and thus not explicitly written or specified in the code. The technical underpinnings of our new precondition mining approach include a technique to analyze the data and control flow in the program leading to API calls to infer preconditions that are implicitly present in the code corpus, a catalog of 35 code elements in total that can be used to derive implicit beliefs from a program, and empirical evaluation of all of these ideas. We have analyzed over 350 millions lines of code and 7 libraries that suffer from the sparse usage problem. Our approach realizes 6 implicit beliefs and we have observed that adding single-level context sensitivity can further improve the result of usage based precondition mining. The result shows that we achieve overall 60% in precision and 69% in recall and the accuracy is relatively improved by 32% in precision and 78% in recall compared to base usage-based mining approach for these libraries. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Libraries; Semantics; Software design; Specifications; Behavioral specification; Context sensitivity; Data-driven approach; Empirical evaluations; Implicit belief; Increased productivity; Pre and post conditions; Specification inferences; Application programming interfaces (API)","Implicit belief; Specification inference; Usage-based mining","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120109301"

At present, several small-scale benchmark datasets for RSIR are publicly available on the web and are mostly collected through the Google Map API or other desktop tools. Because the Google Map API requires the users to have programming skills and other collection tools are not publicly available, this may limit the possibility for a wide range of volunteers to participate in generating large-scale benchmark datasets. To address this challenge, we develop an open access web-based tool V-RSIR that allows volunteers to easily participate in generating new benchmark datasets for RSIR. This web-based tool not only facilitates the remote sensing image label and cropping, but also provides image editing, review, quantity statistics, spatial distribution, sharing, and so on. To validate this tool, we recruit 32 volunteers to label and crop remote sensing images by using the tool. Finally, a new benchmark dataset that contains 38 classes with at least 1500 images per class is created. Then, the new dataset is validated by five handcrafted low-level feature methods and four deep learning high-level feature methods. The experimental results show that the handcrafted low-level feature methods perform worse than the deep learning methods, in which the precision at top 5 can achieve 94%. The evaluation results are consistent with our theoretical understanding and experimental results on the PatternNet dataset.

These applications involve a multitude of sensor and IoT platforms for managing different types of timeseries observations. In many scenarios, timeseries data is the result of specific simulations and is stored in databases and even simple files. To make well-informed decisions, it is essential to have a proper data integration strategy, which must allow working with heterogeneous data sources and platforms in interoperable ways. In this paper, we present a new lightweight web service called InterSensor Service allowing to simply connect to multiple IoT platforms, simulation specific data, databases, and simple files and retrieving their observations without worrying about data storage and the multitude of different APIs. The service encodes these observations “on-the-fly” according to the standardized external interfaces such as the OGC Sensor Observation Service and OGC SensorThings API. In this way, the heterogeneous observations can be analyzed and visualized in a unified way. The service can be deployed not only by the users to connect to different sources but also by providers and stakeholders to simply add further interfaces to their platforms realizing interoperability according to international standards. We have developed a Java-based implementation of the InterSensor Service, which is being offered free as open source software.

Water plays the most important role in the energy-water-food (E-W-F) nexus issue such as energy supply (clean hydropower energy generation), water supply (drinking water), and food supply (agricultural irrigation water). Therefore, water quantity simulation & forecasting become an important issue in E-W-F nexus problem. Water quantity simulation & forecasting model, such as rainfall-runoff (RR) hydrological model has become a useful tool which can significantly improve efficiency of the hydropower energy generation, water supply management, and agricultural irrigation water utilization. The accuracy and reliability of the water quantity simulation & forecasting model are significantly affected by the model parameters. Therefore, demand of effective and fast model parameter optimization tool for solving the E-W-F nexus problem increases significantly. The shuffled complex evolution developed at University of Arizona (SCE-UA) has been recognized as an effective global model parameter optimization method for more than 20 years and is highly suited to solve the E-W-F nexus problem. However, the computational efficiency of the SCE-UA dramatically deteriorates when applied to complex E-W-F nexus problem. For the purpose of solving this conundrum, a fast parallel SCE-UA was proposed in this paper. The parallel SCE-UA was implemented on the novel heterogeneous computing hardware and software systems which were constituted by the Intel multi-core CPU, NVIDIA many-core GPU, and PGI Accelerator Visual Fortran (with OpenMP and CUDA). Performance comparisons between the parallel and serial SCE-UA were carried out based on two case studies, the Griewank benchmark function optimization and a real world IHACRES RR hydrological model parameter optimization. Comparison results indicated that the parallel SCE-UA outperformed the serial one and has good application prospects for solving the water quantity simulation & forecasting model parameter calibration in the E-W-F nexus problem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Arizona; United States; Agricultural runoff; Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Climate models; Computational efficiency; Density measurement (optical); Economics; Food supply; Forecasting; FORTRAN (programming language); Global optimization; Hydroelectric power; Hydrology; Irrigation; Parameter estimation; Population statistics; Water management; Water supply; Cuda fortrans; Energy-water-food nexus; Heterogeneous computing; OpenMP; Parameter optimization; SCE-UA; economic growth; efficiency measurement; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; numerical method; optimization; parameter estimation; population growth; power generation; rainfall-runoff modeling; small scale hydropower; software; water supply; Potable water","CUDA Fortran; Energy-water-food nexus; Heterogeneous computing; OpenMP; Parameter optimization; SCE-UA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981715614"

Rapid simulation of the force and moment exerted by liquid against the spacecraft is rather important for the dynamics and control of the spacecraft. Fast numerical simulation models, especially those capable of dealing with violent liquid sloshing in the lunar soft-landing spacecraft with fluid merging and splitting, are required for real-time control algorithms. For this purpose, a modified smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, namely, noninertial smoothed particle hydrodynamics (NI-SPH), is proposed. In this method, noninertial coordinate system is used to derive transient external excitations to liquid. Meanwhile, the linear and angular momentum theorems of the particle system are adopted to calculate the force and moment exerted by liquid against the spacecraft, which avoids the accuracy loss of the integration of pressures. Furthermore, parallelization based on OpenMP is used to speed up the simulation. To show the accuracy and efficiency, results from the NI-SPH method are compared with those obtained by traditional computational fluid dynamics software, for several 3D liquid sloshing cases. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuel sloshing; Lunar landing; Real time control; Spacecraft; Computational Fluid Dynamics software; Dynamics and control; External excitation; Linear and angular momentums; Merging and splitting; Non-inertial coordinate systems; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods; Hydrodynamics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078537416"

This includes new formats and new propositions, such as personalized immersive social television. Can a lift and shift approach - deploying existing production tools designed for enterprise computing environments into the cloud - deliver these benefits? This paper presents an alternative architecture that is designed to be cloud-fit, using a software-only approach for deploying dynamic software infrastructure. This paper starts by outlining both the benefits and constraints of cloud-based systems, including issues related to virtualized systems being inherently non-realtime. An architecture that overcomes these limitations is then presented, along with an approach for dealing with security and scaling. This consists of a combination of mainly IT tool sets (e.g., monitoring tools, orchestration engines, cloud application programming interfaces, and automated software deployment) with media-specialist software components. An instance of this architecture has been created using an open source Internet of Things wiring tool. This is being trialed as part of the British Broadcasting Corp.

The device is portable, easy to operate, and designed to be worn on the index finger. The Chinese FingerReader on the index finger contains a small camera and buttons. The small camera captures images by identifying the relative position of the index finger to the printed text, and the buttons are applied to capture an image by visually impaired users and provide the audio output of the corresponding Chinese character by a voice prompt. To recognize Chinese characters, English letters, and numbers, a robust Chinese optical character recognition (OCR) system was developed according to the training strategy of an augmented convolution neural network algorithm. The proposed Chinese OCR system can segment a single character from the captured image, and the system can accurately recognize rotated Chinese characters. The experimental results revealed that compared with the OCR application programming interfaces of Google and Microsoft, the proposed OCR system obtains 95% accuracy rate in dealing with rotated character images where the Google and Microsoft OCR APIs only obtain 65% and 34% accuracy rates. These results illustrate that the proposed OCR system was more suitable for the needs of visually impaired people in actual use.

In this paper, we focus on four approaches that use the triangle inequality to avoid unnecessary distance calculations. These approaches are Drake's, Elkan's, Annulus, and Yinyang algorithms. We propose a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization of these algorithms in which the dataset and the corresponding data structures storing bounds on distances are evenly divided among MPI processes. Then, in the assignment step of a K -means iteration, each MPI process computes the assignment of its portion of data using OpenMP threads. In the update step of the iteration, the cluster centroids are computed using a hierarchical all-reduce operation. In the computational experiments, we compared the strong scalability of these four algorithms with the scalability of Lloyd's algorithm, parallelized using the same approach. The results indicate that all four algorithms maintain an advantage in computing time over Lloyd's algorithm. A comparison with two software packages, whose sources are publicly available, in the same computing environment, shows that our implementations are more efficient. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Iterative methods; Scalability; Clustering; Hybrid parallelization; K-means; OpenMP; Triangle inequality; K-means clustering","Clustering; hybrid parallelization.; K-means; MPI; OpenMP; triangle inequality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064858776"

In three-dimensional (3D) spatial domains, the nested double surface integration of GBEM leads to a significantly larger computational time for assembling the linear system than with the standard collocation method. In practice, the computational time is roughly an order of magnitude larger, thus limiting the use of GBEM in 3D engineering problems. The standard approach for reducing the computational time of the linear system assembling is to skip integrations whenever possible. In this work, a modified assembling algorithm for the element matrices in GBEM is proposed for solving integral kernels that depend on the exterior unit normal. This algorithm is based on kernels symmetries at the element level and not on the flow nor in the mesh. It is applied to a BIE that models external creeping flows around 3D closed bodies using second-order kernels, and it is implemented using OpenMP. For these BIEs, the modified algorithm is on average 32% faster than the original one.

Using AutoCAD and OpenGL visual FE modeling, a methodology is proposed for asphalt element generation in FE models; FORTRAN is used to rewrite the model file information and reduce the number of model elements and nodes while boosting modeling and computational efficiency. Implicit lever and column elements are introduced to simulate anchors with and without asphalt coatings, respectively, and appropriate stiffness matrices and iterative FE calculation formulas are derived. The resulting FE model is used to simulate the anchoring system. Results show that the asphalt coating technique reduces the surrounding rock wall’s damage zone and increases anchor stresses inside deep rock masses. This can improve the rock mass mechanical characteristics near the anchors and increase the stabilities of the surrounding rock and the safety crane girder.

Some optimization strategies and rules are proposed, including the extraction of variables and operations from inner loops to outer loops, the merging of related operations in loops, the removal of redundant loops, and the split of loops. In order to achieve better parallelism, OpenMP parallel computing of this method is realized by reversing the order of inner and outer loops.

The focus of this paper is on three newer client storage mechanisms, namely, Web Storage, Web SQL Database, and Indexed Database API. Initially, a large-scale analysis of their usage on the Web is conducted to appraise their usage in the wild. Then, this paper examines the extent that they are used for tracking purposes. The results suggest that Web Storage is the most used among the three technologies.

Scheduling code to utilize parallelism is difficult, particularly when dealing with data dependencies, memory management, data motion, and processor occupancy. The Hybrid Task Graph Scheduler (HTGS) improves programmer productivity when implementing hybrid workflows for multi-core and multi-GPU systems. The Hybrid Task Graph Scheduler (HTGS) is an abstract execution model, framework, and API that increases programmer productivity when implementing hybrid workflows for such systems. HTGS manages dependencies between tasks, represents CPU and GPU memories independently, overlaps computations with disk I/O and memory transfers, keeps multiple GPUs occupied, and uses all available compute resources. Through these abstractions, data motion and memory are explicit; this makes data locality decisions more accessible. To demonstrate the HTGS application program interface (API), we present implementations of two example algorithms: (1) a matrix multiplication that shows how easily task graphs can be used; and (2) a hybrid implementation of microscopy image stitching that reduces code size by ≈ 43% compared to a manually coded hybrid workflow implementation and showcases the minimal overhead of task graphs in HTGS. Both of the HTGS-based implementations show good performance. In image stitching the HTGS implementation achieves similar performance to the hybrid workflow implementation. Matrix multiplication with HTGS achieves 1.3x and 1.8x speedup over the multi-threaded OpenBLAS library for 16k × 16k and 32k × 32k size matrices, respectively. © 2017, US Government (outside the USA).","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Data flow analysis; Graphics processing unit; Matrix algebra; Productivity; Program processors; Scheduling; Dataflow; Heterogeneous architectures; MAtrix multiplication; Task graph; Work-flows; Image processing","Dataflow; Heterogeneous architectures; Hybrid workflows; Image processing; Matrix multiplication; Task graph","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025108758"

Using transmission line theory, only five independent integrals are necessary to form all the components of the dyadic Green's function in order to calculate the tool response, resulting in a more succinct and efficient formulation. The fast Hankel transform (FHT) is then employed to calculate these spectral integrals efficiently. In special cases, such as horizontal and vertical wells where the direct FHT fails, alternative approaches are proposed. A singularity extraction is implemented to handle the divergent integrals for a horizontal well, whereas the double-exponential integration rule is implemented for a vertical well. In order to speed up the computation, the spectral transmission line currents and voltages are precalculated and then stored in memory, and parallel computing using OpenMP is employed.

Users reserve virtual machines to execute their applications with minimum number of processing cores to save money. Optimizing user applications on the level of single core of a physical machine is highly desirable to users to reduce cost, as well as to cloud providers to reduce power consumption. In this paper, we showed how to exploit all the processing resources available in a single CPU physical core to optimize the performance of the 2D spatial filtering operation, a basic kernel in important image and multimedia applications such as image enhancement, edge detection, image segmentation, and image analysis. We proposed a novel computational procedure to restructure the conventional image filtering operation. Then, we demonstrated the merits of combining hand-optimized source-code restructuring, auto-optimized compiler techniques including vectorization, and hand-optimized threading to squeeze the performance of a single CPU core. Our intensive performance evaluations, using Sobel filters, on a variety of image sizes using the Linux Perf tool on a single core of the quad-core Intel Core i7 processor showed that our source-code restructurings with compiler auto-vectorization, using Intel AVX vector instructions, is 1.3X better than the non-restructured auto-vectorized version of the CImg library for computing the image gradient. Moreover, using OpenMP library directives we studied different image partitioning strategies to better exploit the two hardware threads inside a CPU core which boosted performance to 2.6X. Compared with the conventional CImg implementation, we obtained an average enhancement of 5.0X for image sizes ranging from 0.5 MPixel to 8 MPixel. However, comparing our best-optimized code to the conventional non-optimized serial code, without threading, resulted in a significant enhancement of 23X.

Design/methodology/approach: An image analysis technique is used that digitizes the topology information contained in medical images of tissues/organs. A weighted topology reconstruction algorithm is implemented to represent the heterogeneity with parametric functions. The parametric functions are then used to map the spatial material distribution following voxelization. The generated chronological information yields hierarchical tool-path points which are directly transferred to the three-dimensional (3D) bio-printer through a proposed generic platform called Application Program Interface (API). This seamless data corridor between design (virtual) and fabrication (physical) ensures the manufacturability of personalized heterogeneous porous scaffold structure without any CAD/STL file. Findings: The proposed methodology is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the approach and the designed example structures are bio-fabricated with a deposition-based bio-additive manufacturing system. The designed and fabricated heterogeneous structures are evaluated which shows conforming porosity distribution compared to uniform method. Originality/value: In bio-fabrication process, the generated bio-models with boundary representation (B-rep) or surface tessellation (mesh) do not capture the internal architectural information. This paper provides a design methodology for scaffold structure mimicking the native tissue/organ architecture and direct fabricating the structure without reconstructing the CAD model. Therefore, designing and direct bio-printing the heterogeneous topology of tissue scaffolds from medical images minimize the disparity between the internal architecture of target tissue and its scaffold. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printers; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer aided design; Fabrication; Histology; Medical imaging; Porosity; Tissue; Topology; Application program interfaces; Bio-manufacturing; Boundary representations; Design/methodology/approach; Heterogeneous structures; Heterogeneous topologies; Image analysis techniques; Internal heterogeneity; Scaffolds (biology)","Bio-manufacturing; Bio-modeling; Internal heterogeneity; Porosity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054651248"

The CER algorithm is based on the extension rule. We propose a notion of MC-Tree for describing the computing procedure. We implemented the algorithm on a quad-core machine using OpenMP to measure the performance.

In the Roe scheme, flow conditions at inner and outer sides of cell faces are determined using an upwind biased algorithm.

Wi-Fi offloading uses ubiquitous Wi-Fi technology in order to satisfy the ever increasing demand for mobile bandwidth and therefore is an appropriate methodology for mobile operators. As a matter of fact, design and integration of an offloading technology inside mobile network operators’ infrastructures is a challenging task due to convergence issues between the The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and non-3GPP networks. Therefore, a connectivity management platform is a key element for integrated heterogeneous mobile network operators in order to enable smart and effective offloading. In this paper, analysis, design and integration of a connectivity management platform that uses a Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) algorithm for efficient Wi-Fi Offloading in heterogeneous wireless networks is presented. In order to enhance the end-user’s quality-of-experience (QoE), we have especially concentrated on the benefits that can be achieved by exploiting the presence of integrated service provider platform.

BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from BIM in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric BIM data required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop an application programming interface (API) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were conducted.

As in the case of CPU-based system, checkpoint/restart techniques are also expected to improve the dependability of FPGA-based computing. Three issues arise in this situation: how to checkpoint and restart FPGAs, how well this checkpoint/restart model works with the checkpoint/restart model of the whole computing system, and how to build the model by a software tool. In this paper, we first present a new checkpoint/restart architecture along with a checkpointing mechanism on FPGAs. We then propose a method to capture consistent snapshots of FPGA and the rest of the computing system. Third, we provide ""fine-grained"" management for checkpointing to reduce performance degradation. For the host CPU, we also provide a stack which includes API functions to manage checkpoint/restart procedures on FPGAs. Fourth, we present a Python-based tool to insert checkpointing infrastructure. Experimental results show that the checkpointing architecture causes less than 10% maximum clock frequency degradation, low checkpointing latencies, small memory footprints, and small increases in power consumption, while the LUT overhead varies from 17.98% (Dijkstra) to 160.67% (Matrix Multiplication). © Copyright 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Check pointing; Checkpoint-and-restart; Dependability; Long-running applications; MAtrix multiplication; Performance degradation; Small memory footprint; Tree-based; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Checkpointing; Dependability; FPGA; Tree-based","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041551871"

Hence, their structural behavior may be affected by the geometric nonlinearity and they are prone to large displacements and safety issues due to wind loads. Optimal design of such nonlinear and flexible structures is difficult and complicated. This paper presents an automatic optimizing flow for the integrated wind-induced response analysis and wind-resistant optimal design of linear and non-linear lattice structures based on the modified Optimality Criterion (OC) algorithm. The method for structural dynamic analysis and wind-induced response of lattice structure is developed by combining Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Load Dependent Ritz (LDR) vector method, together with the Harmonic Excitation Method (HEM) and Load Response Correlation (LRC) method. Meanwhile the quadratic programming method is used to evaluate the Lagrange multipliers in the modified optimality criterion method. Based on the derived design sensitivity analysis results for the nodal displacements, element stresses and nonlinear critical load factor of linear and nonlinear space frame structures in a companion paper, an automatic optimizing flow is then established by adopting the Application Programming Interface (API) of SAP2000 to integrate the wind-induced response, design sensitivity analysis and wind-resistant optimal design of space frame structural system. The proposed automatic optimizing flow is then applied to the optimized process of a lattice structure under dynamic wind loading. It is found that for the lattice structure, the geometric non-linear analysis and the constraint of nonlinear critical load factor need to be considered in their optimization, meanwhile updating on the time-history of wind loads and Equivalent Static Wind Loads (ESWL) is necessary as result of the variations in the design member size during the optimization process. It is also found that the maximum displacement constraint is the most important factor in the optimization of the lattice structure and maximum stress of structural elements are normally found to be inactive constraints during the optimization procedure. In the case that a low limit for the maximum displacement is pre-set, the nonlinear critical load factor becomes the important constraint. Optimized results from this study would be helpful to those involved in wind resistant analysis and optimization design research for such lattice structures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aerodynamic loads; Application programming interfaces (API); Composite structures; Computer systems programming; Factor analysis; Flexible structures; Lagrange multipliers; Nonlinear analysis; Optimal systems; Principal component analysis; Quadratic programming; Sensitivity analysis; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural frames; Wind stress; Critical load factors; Lattice structures; Non-linear design; Optimal design; Optimality criteria; design method; dynamic analysis; loading; optimization; response analysis; structural response; wind stress; Shape optimization","Lattice structure; Non-linear critical load factor; Non-linear design sensitivity; Optimality criterion; Wind-resistant optimal design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049755248"

Based on multicore parallel and graphics processing unit (GPU) computing techniques, the large-scale data of a finite element model and the corresponding graphics data can be handled and rendered effectively. The proposed strategies mainly consist of four parts. First, a parallel surface extraction technology based on the dual connections of elements and nodes is developed to reduce the graphics data. Second, the OpenGL vertex buffer object (VBO) technology is used to improve the rendering efficiency after surface extraction. Third, the element-hiding and cut-surface functions are implemented to facilitate the observation of the interior of the meshes. Finally, the stream/filter architecture, which has the advantages of efficient computation and communication, is introduced to meet the needs of large-scale data processing and various visualization methods. These strategies are developed on the general visualization system SiPESC.Post. Using these strategies, SiPESC.Post implements high-performance display and real-time operation for large-scale finite element models, especially for models containing millions or tens of millions of elements.

To this end, numerous eco-feedback systems have been developed to reduce building energy use through influencing occupants' behaviors during building operations. Information representation is a critical component in eco-feedback systems, affecting the users' interpretation, engagement, and motivation to reduce energy consumption. Many studies have focused on using different charts and technical units or abstract and artistic visualizations to represent energy consumption. However, the effectiveness of such techniques varies across studies. Recent research emphasizes the need to integrate information representation strategies that balance numeric and aesthetic appeal. Concurrently, studies have called for increased adoption of a Building Information Model (BIM) during a building's operations phase to improve facility management. In this paper, we introduce a new eco-feedback information representation method that combines numeric and aesthetic appeal through leveraging spatial and color-coding techniques in BIM. The BIM-integrated energy visualization approach developed in this paper uses the Revit Application Program Interface (API) and allows users to visualize and compare energy consumption values in 2D and 3D views of a multi-family building through a color-coding scheme in an as-built BIM. The method is validated through a user survey that quantitatively and qualitatively assesses the proposed 2D and 3D BIM eco-feedback compared to more traditional bar chart based eco-feedback. Our findings suggest that 2D spatial, color-coded eco-feedback provides the optimal information representation, as it is easy to understand, while evoking engaging and motivating responses from users. This study advances our understanding of eco-feedback information representation while expanding BIM applications during building operations.

For accomplishing ExaFlops execution through the Ultrascale framework, the present innovations are confronting several challenges. Huge parallelism is one of these challenges, which requires a novel low power consuming parallel programming approach for attaining massive performance. This paper introduced a new parallel programming model that achieves massive parallelism by combining coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelism over inter-node and intra-node computation respectively. The proposed framework is tri-hybrid of MPI, OpenMP, and compute unified device architecture (MOC) that compute input data over heterogeneous framework. We implemented the proposed model in linear algebraic dense matrix multiplication application, and compared the quantified metrics with well-known basic linear algebra subroutine libraries such as CUDA basic linear algebra subroutines library and KAUST basic linear algebra subprograms.

Parallel computing has provided an effective approach to improve the computational efficiency and expand the processing scales of polygon overlay algorithms. Polygon overlay analysis algorithms that are based on traditional vector polygon clipping algorithms will experience significant efficiency decreases when handling overlap among polygons that have quantities of vertices. The discretization processing method-based rasterization-based polygon clipping algorithm (RaPC) algorithm exhibits higher efficiency for addressing clipping issues among such polygons. In this paper, we designed and implemented two types of parallel polygon overlay analysis algorithms to determine the differences in efficiency between the RaPC algorithm and the Vatti algorithm under the open multi-processing and message passing interface parallel computing environments. The results show that parallel polygon overlay analysis methods based on the RaPC algorithm present advantages for processing overlap among large data sets.

Efficient identification of evolving malware is an urgent challenge. Traditional methods based on structured features such as permissions and sensitive application programming interface (API) calls lack high-level behavioral semantics to detect evolving malware. The methods based on call graphs (CG) are good at behavioral semantic analysis but face the problem of huge time and space consumption, which leads to low detection efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel Android malware detection method based on the method-level correlation relationship of application's abstracted API calls. First, we split each Android application's source code into separate function methods and just keep the abstracted API calls of them to form a set of abstracted API calls transactions. And then, we calculate the confidence of association rules between the abstracted API calls, which forms behavioral semantics to describe an application. Finally, we combine machine learning to identify the different behavioral patterns of malicious and benign apps to build the detection system. The results of our empirical evaluation show our system is competitive in terms of classification accuracy and detection efficiency. At dataset Drebin (benign 5.9K and malware 5.6K) and AMD (benign 20.5K and malware 20.8K), our system has achieved 96% and 98% detection results both in accuracy and F-measure. Compared with the state-of-the-art system in detecting evolving malware called MaMaDroid on the dataset of 6.0K benign and 20.5K malicious samples spanning from 2010 to 2017, our system achieves higher accuracy while improving detection efficiency by 15 times (2.9 s versus 45.7 s per sample). © 2013 IEEE.","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Efficiency; Learning systems; Machine learning; Malware; Semantics; Android malware; API calls; Association analysis; Behavioral semantics; Classification accuracy; Empirical evaluations; Sensitive application; State-of-the-art system; Android (operating system)","abstracted API call; Android malware detection; association analysis; behavioral semantics; machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067212559"

Highly functional application-to-application communication services such as bandwidth aggregation, fault tolerant communication, and delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) were developed independently in the network layer, the transport layer, and the application layer. As a result, protocol layering has become complicated. This paper proposes to insert Layer-5 (L5) between the application layer and the transport layer to separate communication policies and communication mechanisms to make protocol layering clearer. The transport layer (L4) provides end-to-end communication mechanisms such as reliable byte stream while L5 realizes communication policies such as bandwidth aggregation by combining the communication mechanisms in L4. This paper proposes five types of L5-paths as communication policies: (1) the L5 bundled path for bandwidth aggregation or fault tolerant communication, (2) the L5 spatially-spliced path for communication with middleboxes, (3) the L5 temporally-spliced path for DTN, (4) the L5 spliced-bundled path, and (5) the L5 bundled over spatially-spliced path. An application can select and use an appropriate L5-path depending on the network circumstances through a common API. A prototype of L5 is implemented in the Linux user space as a library to make deployment and maintenance easier. An evaluation shows that establishment time of L5-paths is short enough and performance of L5-paths is comparable or superior to existing technologies. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bandwidth; Computer operating systems; Delay tolerant networks; Fault tolerance; Network architecture; Communication mechanisms; Delay/disruption tolerant networkings; End-to-End communication; Fault tolerant communications; Functional applications; Layer-5; Middleboxes; Multipath; Network layers","Layer-5; Middlebox; Multipath; Network architecture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053840663"

In this paper, a novel matching approach is proposed for the large size HR satellite image registration, which is based on coarse-to-fine strategy and geometric scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). In the coarse matching step, a robust matching method scale restrict (SR) SIFT is implemented at low resolution level. The matching results provide geometric constraints which are then used to guide block division and geometric SIFT in the fine matching step. The block matching method can overcome the memory problem. In geometric SIFT, with area constraints, it is beneficial for validating the candidate matches and decreasing searching complexity. To further improve the matching efficiency, the proposed matching method is parallelized using OpenMP. Finally, the sensing image is rectified to the coordinate of reference image via Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) transformation. Experiments are designed to test the performance of the proposed matching method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can decrease the matching time and increase the number of matching points while maintaining high registration accuracy. © 2018 by the authors.

First, the casing material was tested to judge whether its properties were normal. Secondly, the testing matrix was defined to determine actual casing exposure conditions. Thirdly, slow strain rate testing was used to screen the conditions. Fourthly, thirty-day tests of uniaxial tensile specimens were conducted to check for SSC susceptibility. The casing material satisfied API 5CT standards and could be used for slow strain rate testing and sulfide stress cracking testing. The testing matrix is intended to distinguish the combined effect of temperatures (41, 75, 140 °F), chloride levels (1000, 13 000 mg × L-1), pH (3.5, 5.5) and partial pressures of H2S (3.5 psi) in shut-in and flowing conditions. The slow strain rate testing showed a reduction of signs of embrittlement with increased temperature, suggesting that the mechanism is supported by sulfide stress cracking. The 13Cr-L80 passed field-specific qualification tests for sulfide stress cracking resistance in sour wells at maximum H2S partial pressures of 3.5 psi in the casing-tubing annulus. The API 5CT 13Cr-L80 casing application is in compliance with ISO15156/ NACE MR0175 standards as long as the aggressiveness of the field conditions does not go beyond the envelope conditions tested (3.5 psi of H2S, pH 3.5, temperature of 41 or 75 °F). © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co.

The motivating factors are device and user mobiliy, i.e., to let the user determine where application components should execute at all times. In order to organize and locate roaming devices, a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay is developed. To provide location transparency for application developers and enable efficient data sharing among application components, an API is provided that hides whether shared memory or latency optimized network distribution is used to share data. The problem of open TCP connections to third-party applications is solved with a proxy-based approach. Multimedia applications are especially sensitive to service interruptions that can be caused by migration, and a new approach for check-pointing, state transfer, and resuming an application with minimal freeze time is therefore introduced. The evaluation of TRAMP shows that this optimization for low freeze time has significant effect. For example, migrating the Skype video-conferencing application with TRAMP reduces the average freeze time from 41.1 seconds with legacy approaches to 213 milliseconds. Further results from the empirical evaluation of TRAMP demonstrate that it has no negative impact on the Quality of Experience. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed computer systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Middleware; Mobile computing; Multimedia systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Ubiquitous computing; Video conferencing; Application components; Application developers; Mobile and ubiquitous computing; Mobile applications; Multi-media communications; Multimedia applications; Quality of experience (QoE); Third party application (Apps); Application programming interfaces (API)","middleware; Mobile applications; mobile computing; multimedia communication; ubiquitous computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032267892"

One of the main components of SRL is learners' self-monitoring, which eventually contributes to a better performance. Monitoring is also important for teachers, as it enables them to know to what extent their learners are doing well and progressing properly. At the same time, the use of technology for learning is now common and facilitates monitoring. Nevertheless, the available software still offers poor support from the SRL point of view, especially, for SRL monitoring. This clashes with the growth of learning analytics and educational data mining. The main issue is the wide variety of SRL actions that need to be captured, commonly performed in different tools, and the need to integrate them to support the development of analytics and data mining developments, making imperative the search of interoperable solutions. This paper focuses on the standardization of SRL traces to enable data collection from multiple sources and data analysis with the goal of easing the monitoring process for teachers and learners. First, the paper analyzes current monitoring software and its limitations for SRL. Then, after a brief analysis of available standards on this area, an application profile for the eXperience API specification is proposed to enable the interoperable recording of the SRL traces. The paper describes the process followed to create the profile, from the analysis to the final implementation, including the selection of the interactions that represent relevant SRL actions, the selection of vocabularies to record them and a case study. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer software; Data mining; Educational technology; Job analysis; Planning; Standardization; Standards; Teaching; Tools; Cognition; Competence development; Current monitoring; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Self-regulated learning; Self-regulated learning strategies; Task analysis; Monitoring","Educational technology; learning analytics; self-regulated learning; standardization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050723006"

This is to abstract the underlying communication structure and means for accessing and controlling a 3D printer resource in one of three ways. The first way is a proprietary protocol or a 3D printer driver in Microsoft Windows. The second way is the control via a USB-serial connection between a controlling computer and the printer resource. This protocol can either be in a proprietary format or based on open standards like G-Code (ISO 6983-1:2009). The third way of control is based on physical storage devices attached to the printer with machining instructions stored on them. This research excludes the communication and control means involving proprietary protocols or drivers due complexity restrictions within the implementation. The approach is designed with extensibility in mind so that future access to proprietary protocols can be added to the control API. 3D printer resources with only the third control method available are also excluded from this research due to their lack of remote controllability. This work describes the design and implementation of an abstraction API layer between varying software and hardware components with an extensible architecture for future hardware and software components for within the domain of additive manufacturing (AM). With this research, the connection to further cloud services as 3D printing resources as well as a cloud printing service for usage and control of this API is demonstrated. This enables the use of AM machinery within cloud or business process-oriented architectures as the AM machinery and the associated software are exposed in an abstract and unified way and usable as services. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer control; Computer hardware; Distributed database systems; Hardware; Machinery; Manufacture; Printers (computer); Printing; Printing machinery; Printing presses; Remote control; Virtual storage; Web services; 3-D printing; Abstraction layer; Cloud-based; Communication and control; Communication structures; Design and implementations; Hardware and software components; Software and hardwares; 3D printers","3D printing; Abstraction layer; Additive manufacturing; API; CBM; Cloud-based manufacturing; Cloud-based service; CPS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015249046"

Furthermore, various named entity normalization models are integrated into BERN for assigning a distinct identifier to each recognized entity. The BERN provides a Web service for tagging entities in PubMed articles or raw text.

The task of detecting driving cycles (driving or car-mode trajectory segments) from wearable GPS data has been the subject of much research. Specifically, distinguishing driving cycles from other motorized trips (such as taking a bus) is the main research problem in this paper. Many mode detection methods only focus on raw GPS speed data while some studies apply additional information, such as geographic information system (GIS) data, to obtain better detection performance. Procuring and maintaining dedicated road GIS data are costly and not trivial, whereas the technical maturity and broad use of map service application program interface (API) queries offers opportunities for mode detection tasks. The proposed driving cycle detection method takes advantage of map service APIs to obtain high-quality car-mode API route information and uses a trajectory segmentation algorithm to find the best-matched API route. The car-mode API route data combined with the actual route information, including the actual mode information, are used to train a logistic regression machine learning model, which estimates car modes and non-car modes with probability rates.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a device designed for visually impaired people to interact with virtual scenes of video games. The device has been designed considering usability, economic cost, and adaptability as main features. To ensure usability, we considered the white cane paradigm since this is the most used device by the blind community. Our device supports left to right movements and collision detection as well as actions to manipulate scene objects such as drag and drop. To enhance realism, it also integrates a library with sounds of different materials to reproduce object collision. To reduce the economic cost, we used Arduino as the basis of our development. Finally, to ensure adaptability, we created an application programming interface that supports the connection with different games engines and different scenarios. To test the acceptance of the device 12 blind participants were considered (6 males and 6 females). In addition, we created three mini-games in Unity3D that require navigation and walking as principal actions. After playing, participants filled a questionnaire related to usability and suitability to interact with games, among others.

These urban scale reduced-order models rely on the contribution of influential variables to the internal, external, and system thermal loads. OpenStudio Application Programming Interface (API) serves as a tool to automate the process of model creation and demonstrate the developed framework. The results of this study show that the accuracy of the developed reduced-order building energy models varies only up to 10% with the selection of different thermal zones. In addition, to assess complexity of the developed reduced-order building energy models, this study develops a novel framework to quantify complexity of the building energy models. Consequently, this study empowers the building energy modelers to quantify their building energy model systematically in order to report the model complexity alongside the building energy model accuracy. An exhaustive analysis on four university campuses suggests that the urban neighborhood buildings lend themselves to simplified typical shapes. Specifically, building energy modelers can utilize the developed typical shapes to represent more than 80% of the U.S. buildings documented in the CBECS database. One main benefits of this developed framework is the opportunity for different models including airflow and solar radiation models to share the same exterior representation, allowing a unifying exchange data.

This paper designs a 3D panoramic viewing system. The real-time performance of the panoramic system requires a large number of parallel image transformations.

The core computing module is based on NXP's i.MX6Q application processor and builds an embedded Linux system. Using V4L2 to capture images to reduce memory and CPU usage, and use OpenGL ES shaders to process image transformations in parallel at high speed. Because it is in a 3D environment, it is impossible to cover all images through a still viewpoint like a 2D look-around. In order to roam the 3D scene, this paper proposes to design a virtual camera system. Using the virtual camera to roam the 3D environment, realize the virtual viewpoint in the 3D scene, traverse each scene in the grid, eliminate the dead angle of the field of view, and finally realize the 3D panoramic view, and verified on the embedded hardware platform, which can clearly roam every image on the surface.

The present solver is based on a conservative hyperbolic formulation derived from a variational analysis of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and is implemented using an explicit high-order finite difference strategy. In this work, a WENO–Z reconstruction scheme along with a high-order finite-difference stencil are used to approximate the contributions of convective and diffusive spatial operators, respectively. The spatial operators are then associated to a low–storage Runge–Kutta scheme to integrate the system explicitly in time. The present multi-GPU implementation aims to make the best use of every single GPU and gain optimal performance of the algorithm on the per-node basis. To assess the performance of the present solver, a typical mini-server computer with 4 Tesla K80 dual GPU accelerators is used. The results show that the present formulation scales linearly for large domain problems. Moreover, when compared to an OpenMP implementation running with an i7 processor of 4.2 GHz, this is outperformed by our MPI-GPU implementation by a factor of 99.

Consequentially, there is a corresponding lack of tools for on-the-fly 3D visualization of these point cloud uncertainties. Visualization tools could be incredibly valuable for analyzing and communicating the spatial variability of uncertainty in a data set, ultimately enhancing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This study presents an efficient visualization framework for terrestrial laser-scanning (TLS) point cloud uncertainty calculation utilizing the OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL). The methods were tested on four data sets, ranging from a controlled indoor scene containing objects representing simple geometric shapes (e.g., spheres and cones) to a complex forest environment with many types of natural objects.

However, the dramatic increase of Android malicious applications (malapps) has caused serious software failures to Android system and posed a great threat to users. The effective detection of Android malapps has thus become an emerging yet crucial issue. Characterizing the behaviors of Android applications (apps) is essential to detecting malapps. Most existing works on detecting Android malapps were mainly based on string static features, such as permissions and API usage extracted from apps. There also exists work on the detection of Android malapps with structural features, such as control flow graph and data flow graph. As Android malapps have become increasingly polymorphic and sophisticated, using only one type of static features may result in false negatives. In this paper, we propose DroidEnsemble that takes advantages of both string features and structural features to systematically and comprehensively characterize the static behaviors of Android apps and thus build a more accurate detection model for the detection of Android malapps. We extract each app's string features, including permissions, hardware features, filter intents, restricted API calls, used permissions, code patterns, as well as structural features like function call graph. We then use three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, to evaluate the performance of these two types of features and of their ensemble. In the experiments, we evaluate our methods and models with 1386 benign apps and 1296 malapps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DroidEnsemble. It achieves the detection accuracy as 95.8% with only string features and as 90.68% with only structural features. DroidEnsemble reaches the detection accuracy as 98.4% with the ensemble of both types of features, reducing 9 false positives and 12 false negatives compared to the results with only string features. © 2018 IEEE.","Android (operating system); Anthropomorphic robots; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer hardware; Computer software; Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Decision trees; Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Hardware; Learning algorithms; Malware; Nearest neighbor search; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Support vector machines; Androids; Application analysis; Humanoid robot; Malware analysis; Software failure; Feature extraction","Android malicious application analysis; malware analysis; software failure reduction; static analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046759191"

Some recent adaptations have significantly increased the flexibility of the software for different environmental and engineering applications. This paper gives an overview of the most significant changes of HPx, such as coupling transport properties to geochemical state variables, gas diffusion, and transport in two and three dimensions. OpenMP allows for parallel computing using shared memory. Enhancements for scripting may eventually simplify input definitions and create possibilities for defining templates for generic (sub)problems. We included a discussion of root solute uptake and colloid-affected solute transport to show that most or all of the comprehensive features of HYDRUS can be extended with geochemical information. Finally, an example is used to demonstrate how HPx, and similar reactive transport models, can be helpful in implementing different factors relevant for soil organic matter dynamics in soils.

However, until now, the lack of common legal basis prevented European Member States from recognizing and accepting eIDs issued in the other Member States. The electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation provides a solution to these issues by ensuring the cross-border mutual recognition of eIDs. FIWARE is a European initiative that provides a rather simple yet powerful set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that ease the development of smart applications in multiple vertical sectors and oriented to the future internet. In this paper, we propose a model that enables the connection of FIWARE OAuth 2.0-based services with the eID authentication provided by eIDAS reference. Thanks to this model, services already connected with an OAuth 2.0 identity provider can be automatically connected with eIDAS nodes for providing eID authentication to European citizens. For validating the proposed model, we have deployed an instance of the FIWARE identity manager connected to the Spanish eIDAS node. Then, we have registered two services, a private videoconferencing system, and a public smart city deployment, and extended their functionalities for enriching the user experience leveraging the eID authentication. We have evaluated the integration of both services in the eIDAS network with real users from seven different countries. We conclude that the proposed model facilitates the integration of generic and FIWARE-based OAuth 2.0 services to the eIDAS infrastructure, making the connection transparent for developers. © 2013 IEEE.","Access control; Application programming interfaces (API); Authentication; Video conferencing; Automatically connected; eIDAS; European initiatives; European regulation; FIWARE; identity; Smart applications; Videoconferencing systems; Laws and legislation","Access Control; eIDAS; electronic identification; FIWARE; identity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069771649"

We introduce a high-fidelity ground vehicle mobility simulation framework that uses physics-based models of the vehicle, tyres, and terrain to factor in both tyre flexibility and soil deformation. The tyres are modelled using a nonlinear finite element approach that involves layers of orthotropic shell elements. The soil is represented as a large collection of rigid elements that interact through contact, friction, and cohesive forces. The high-fidelity vehicle models incorporate suspension, steering, driveline, and powertrain models. To alleviate the prohibitive computational costs associated with a coupled simulation of the overall problem, we propose a decoupled approach implemented as an explicit, force-displacement co-simulation framework which is demonstrated on several full-vehicle on soft soil simulations.

In this paper, we provide the first of a kind study in which we compare the performance of 14 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods in the mobile environment. To do that, we adapted these methods to run on Android OS and then, we measure their performance in terms of memory, CPU, and battery consumption. Our findings unveil methods that require almost no adaptations and run relatively fast as well as methods that could not be deployed due to excessive use of memory.

An evaluation is performed on the EM leakage as the device executes the AES-128 cryptographic algorithm contained in the libcrypto++ library in a threaded environment. Four multi-threaded implementations are evaluated. These implementations are Portable Operating System Interface Threads, C++11 threads, Threading Building Blocks, and OpenMP threads. It is demonstrated that the various thread techniques have distinct variations in frequency and shape as EM emanations are leaked from the Raspberry Pi. It is demonstrated that the AES-128 cryptographic implementation within the libcrypto++ library on a Raspberry Pi is vulnerable to Side Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. The cryptographic process was seen visibly within the EM spectrum and the data for this process was extracted where digital filtering techniques was applied to the signal. The resultant data was utilised in the Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA) attack and the results revealed 16 sub-keys that are required to recover the full AES-128 secret key. Based on this discovery, this research introduced a multi-threading approach with the utilisation of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to serve as a software based countermeasure to mitigate SCA attacks.

Behavior features based on API play an important role in analyzing malware variants. However, the existing malware detection approaches have a lot of complex operations on construction and matching. Graph matching is an NP-complete problem and is time-consuming because of computational complexity. To address these issues, a promising approach is proposed to construct the classified behavior features from different malware families. In the proposed approach, a classified behavior feature consists of a kernel object (an API call parameter) and a series of operations (an API trace). Besides, a classified behavior graph (CBG) is represented as a number by hash to reduce workload and matching time. Subsequently, multiple machine learning classifiers are used for system classification. In particular, to verify the efficiency of our approach, we perform a series of experiments with different families. The experiments on 1220 malware samples show that the true positive rate is up to 88.3% and the false positive rate keeps within 3.9% by the support vector machine (SVM). © 2019 IEEE.","Computational complexity; Computer systems programming; Malware; Object oriented programming; Support vector machines; API calls; classified behavior; Complex operations; False positive rates; Malware detection; Multiple machine; System classification; True positive rates; Application programming interfaces (API)","API call parameter; classified behavior; malware variant; SVM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068711133"

They are distinguished from taxis primarily by the presumption that vehicles are privately owned by drivers. Unlike taxis, which must hold one of approximately 1,800 medallions licensed by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) to operate in San Francisco, there is no regulatory limit on the supply of TNCs. TNCs have an increasingly visible presence in San Francisco. However, there has been little or no objective data available on TNCs to allow planners to understand the number of trips they provide, the amount of vehicle miles traveled they generate, or their effects on congestion, transit ridership, transit operations, or safety. Without this type of data it is difficult to make informed planning and policy decisions. Discussions with Uber, Lyft, and the California Public Utilities Commission, which collects trip-level data from TNCs in California, requesting information on TNC trips have not resulted in any data being shared. Under increasing pressure from policymakers for objective data to inform policy decisions, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) partnered with researchers from Northeastern University who developed a methodology for collecting data through Uber’s and Lyft’s application programming interfaces (APIs) with high spatial and temporal resolution. This paper provides a brief literature review on transport network company (TNC) data, and goes one to describe the methodology used to collect data, summarizes the process for converting the raw data into estimated TNC trips, and presents an analysis of the results of the TNC trip estimates. This study determined that TNCs serve a substantial number of trips in San Francisco, over 170,000 on a typical weekday, that these trips follow traditional time of day distributions, and that they tend to take place in the busiest parts of the City. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Decision making; Public utilities; Traffic congestion; Transportation routes; Vehicles; Municipal transportation; Northeastern University; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Transit operations; Transit riderships; Transport networks; Transportation network; Vehicle-miles traveled; Data acquisition","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060879831"

Our proposed decomposition methodology uses word embedding models to obtain word representations using operation names, as well as, using a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar operation names together in order to get suitable microservices. Also, using grid search method to find the optimal parameter values for Affinity Propagation algorithm, which was used for clustering, as well as using silhouette coefficient score to compare the performance of the clustering parameters. The decomposition approach that was introduced in this research consists of the OpenAPI specifications as an input, then extracts the operation names from the specifications and converts them into average word embedding using fastText model. Lastly the decomposition approach is grouping these operation names using Affinity Propagation algorithm.

The purpose of this paper is to take the advantages of effective multithreaded computing of OpenMP and MATLAB’s user-friendly interface and real-time display capability. Design/methodology/approach: A validation of computing performance of MATLAB and Fortran coding for solving two simple sliders by iterative solution methods is conducted. The online display of the particles’ search process is incorporated in the MATLAB coding, and the execution of the air foil bearing optimum design is conducted by using OpenMP multithreaded computing in the background. The optimization analysis is conducted by particle swarm optimization method for an air foil bearing design. Findings: It is found that the MATLAB programs require prolonged execution times than those by using Fortran computing in iterative methods. The execution time of the air foil bearing optimum design is significantly minimized by using the OpenMP computing. As a result, the cross-platform paradigm can provide a useful graphical user interface. And very little code rewritting of the original numerical models is required, which is usually optimized for either serial or parallel computing. Research limitations/implications: Iterative methods are commonly applied in fluid-film lubrication analyses. In this study, iterative methods are used as the solution methods, which may not be an effective way to compute in the MATLAB’s setting. Originality/value: In this study, a cross-platform paradigm consisting of a standalone MATLAB and Fortran codes is proposed. The approach combines the best of the two paradigms and each coding can be modified or maintained independently for different applications. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bearings (structural); Computational fluid dynamics; Foil bearings; FORTRAN (programming language); Graphical user interfaces; Iterative methods; Lubrication; Optimization; Parallel processing systems; Parallel programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Design/methodology/approach; Fluid-film lubrication; Iterative solution methods; MATALB; OpenMP; Optimal design; Parallel programming model; Particle swarm optimization method; MATLAB","Bearings; Computational fluid dynamics; Fluid-film lubrication; MATALB; OpenMP; Optimal design; Optimization; Parallel computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049634961"

Further, the suggested technique is implemented in parallel approach which is faster than serial implementation. The achieved speedup factor is 150× and 5× using GPU and eight cores multiprocessor, respectively with respect to a single core processing time of 215 steps input Gaussian beam.

For this purpose, we propose an object-oriented (OO) application programming interface in the form of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML). In contrast to the traditional OO approach, the proposed framework deliberately avoids the use of subclassing for concrete implementations of node and element classes; it uses external objects, namely descriptors, instead. The descriptive design of the DSML provides developers with generic programming support for the construction and solution of discretization schemes, in the context of partial differential equations, in a self-explanatory syntax. We take advantage of Python’s descriptor protocol to make descriptors behave like natural dependencies of their owner class. We propose several descriptors to account for both theoretical and implementation-specific aspects of FE programming. By using concrete examples, we demonstrate that enhancing these descriptors with both symbolic and numerical computational utilities results in a concise and customizable code base for analysis and pre/postprocessing purposes. We select Python as the base programming language because of its support for essential programming features such as customizable classes, dynamic code, arbitrary arguments, method decoration, and descriptor protocol. © TÜBİTAK.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computation theory; Concretes; Finite element method; High level languages; Mathematical programming; Modeling languages; Program translators; Specification languages; Automated; Computer implementations; Descriptive; Discretization scheme; Domain specific modeling languages; Finite element theories; Generic programming; Object oriented; Object oriented programming","Automated; Descriptive; Finite element; Object-oriented; Programming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063014667"

Science is living a golden era characterized by a rapidly growing number of researchers worldwide exploring different disciplines and research fields. Keeping in mind that funding is limited, many researchers are encouraged to establish new collaborations with individuals or groups of researchers. Furthermore, the funding bodies use increasingly complex criteria to determine the researchers and projects to be supported. In this regard, the analysis of scientific collaboration networks can help to determine the main areas of specialization of universities and research centres, as well as the type of internal and external collaborations of their researchers. This paper presents an advanced method for analysing scientific collaboration networks at universities and research institutions. This method is based on automatically obtaining bibliographic data from scientific publications through the use of the Scopus Database API Interface, which are then analysed using graph visualization software and statistical tools. This model has been validated through the analysis of a real university, and the results show that it is possible to determine in a fast way and with high reliability the main research lines of an institution as well as the structure of the collaboration network.

Performance studies using EVPFFT are performed based on domain decomposition over voxels of a periodic cell, which is a representative volume element (RVE) of polycrystalline copper. We begin by parallelizing the computationally intensive Newton–Raphson (NR) single crystal solver within EVPFFT. Next, we compare the performance of the serial and parallel FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) using OpenMP (OpenMP-FFTW) and MPI (MPI-FFTW) with the original Numerical Recipes-based FOURN routine within EVPFFT. In the parallel environment, we find that the FFT calculations are best performed using the MPI version of FFTW. Finally, the remainder of the code, except read/write subroutines, is parallelized. Significant speedups of the original EVPFFT model are achieved using MPI on shared memory multicore workstations. Furthermore, results achieved on a distributed memory Cray supercomputer show promising strong and weak scalability and in some cases even super scalability for the single crystal NR solver in EVPFFT. MPI-FFTW also scales perfectly for microstructure RVEs larger than 643 FFT voxels. For example, the MPI-EVPFFT parallel version of the code accelerates the simulations for approximately two orders of magnitude using 64 cores over the old serial code for an RVE size of 1283. The parallel EVPFFT code developed in this work can run massive voxel-based microstructural RVEs taking the advantages of thousands of logical cores provided by more advanced clusters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Constitutive equations; Domain decomposition methods; Fast Fourier transforms; Memory architecture; Message passing; Parallel processing systems; Plasticity; Scalability; Supercomputers; Cray supercomputers; Crystal plasticity; Crystal plasticity models; Message passing interface; Parallel environment; Parallel implementations; Polycrystalline copper; Representative volume element (RVE); Single crystals","Constitutive equations; Cray supercomputer; Crystal plasticity; MPI; Parallel computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054746260"

In the current state of the art, this tuning is generally performed in one of two ways: either by a group of experts who derive a single setup which achieves good – but not optimal – performance across a wide variety of use cases, or by monitoring a system’s behavior at runtime and responding to it. The former approach invariably fails to achieve optimal performance for programs with highly distinct execution patterns, while the latter induces overhead and cannot affect parameters which need to be set at compile time. In order to mitigate these drawbacks, we propose a set of novel static compiler analyses specifically designed to determine program features which affect the optimal settings for a task-parallel execution environment. These features include the parallel structure of task spawning, the granularity of individual tasks, the memory size of the closure required for task parameters, and an estimate of the stack size required per task. Based on the result of these analyses, various runtime system parameters are then tuned at compile time. We have implemented this approach in the Insieme compiler and runtime system, and evaluated its effectiveness on a set of 12 task parallel benchmarks running with 1 to 64 hardware threads. Across this entire space of use cases, our implementation achieves a geometric mean performance improvement of 39%. To illustrate the impact of our optimizations, we also provide a comparison to current state-of-the art task-parallel runtime systems, including OpenMP, Cilk, HPX, and Intel TBB. © 2018, The Author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Multiprocessing systems; Static analysis; Compiler; Parallel patterns; Runtimes; Task granularity; Task parallelism; Program compilers","Compiler; Parallel pattern; Runtime; Static analysis; Task granularity; Task parallelism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045953748"

In this letter, a novel approach based on the block and octave constraint scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is proposed for very high-resolution satellite image matching. Details regarding multi-thread processing are provided. First, the corresponding matching block is observed using rational function model (RFM) prediction. The RFM prediction can provide a geometric constraint. In each block matching, keypoints are classified with the feature octave. The keypoints are matched in the group with the same feature octave. The block and octave constraint can narrow the keypoints search scope and be helpful for acquiring additional matches. Since blocks are independent, each corresponding block matching is parallelized to realize multi-thread processing with open multi-processing (OpenMP). Experiments are designed to test the matching performance and runtime. The results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer architecture; Efficiency; Image matching; Motion compensation; Rational functions; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Geometric constraint; Intensity change; Matching performance; Rational function model; Repetitive structure; Scale invariant feature transforms; Very high resolution satellite images; efficiency measurement; experimental design; geometry; image processing; satellite imagery; Satellite imagery","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054206852"

Context data plays a key role in code and API recommendation. A large amount of programming onsite data has been generated, but existing code and API recommendation systems rarely consider the context based on programming onsite data, which leads to low efficiency and poor accuracy of code and API recommendation. In this paper, we proposed a context model for code and API recommendation systems. Our context model is based on programming onsite data collected during programming. It includes four aspects: developer, project, time, and environment. Developer data is labeled data abstracted from information according to developers' programming habits and abilities, project data is information about the project, time data is information about temporal aspects of developers interacting with the project, and environment data is all environment elements used by developers during programming. Then, we collected programming onsite data in three ways: explicit collection, implicit collection, and reasoning. Lastly, we built the context model using a coarse-grained abstract model for recommendation. Our context model retains the key information in the code while eliminating redundant information that may affect the accuracy of the recommend task, and it can theoretically improve the efficiency and accuracy of recommendation. © 2019 Totem Publisher, Inc.

The traffic congestion index (TCI) exceeds 2.0 during rush hour in some cities. Inefficient processing for minor traffic accidents is considered to be one of the leading causes for road traffic jams. Meanwhile, the process after an accident is quite troublesome. The main reason is that it is almost always impossible to get the complete chain of evidence when the accident happens. Accordingly, a police and insurance joint management system is developed which is based on high precision BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)/Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning to process traffic accidents. First of all, an intelligent vehicle rearview mirror terminal is developed. The terminal applies a commonly used consumer electronic device with single frequency navigation. Based on the high precision BDS/GPS positioning algorithm, its accuracy can reach sub-meter level in the urban areas. More specifically, a kernel driver is built to realize the high precision positioning algorithm in an Android HAL layer. Thus the third-party application developers can call the general location Application Programming Interface (API) of the original standard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to get high precision positioning results. Therefore, the terminal can provide lane level positioning service for car users. Next, a remote traffic accident processing platform is built to provide big data analysis and management. According to the big data analysis of information collected by BDS high precision intelligent sense service, vehicle behaviors can be obtained. The platform can also automatically match and screen the data that uploads after an accident to achieve accurate reproduction of the scene. Thus, it helps traffic police and insurance personnel to complete remote responsibility identification and survey for the accident. Thirdly, a rapid processing flow is established in this article to meet the requirements to quickly handle traffic accidents. The traffic police can remotely identify accident responsibility and the insurance personnel can remotely survey an accident. Moreover, the police and insurance joint management system has been carried out in Wuhan, Central China’s Hubei Province, and Wuxi, Eastern China’s Jiangsu Province. In a word, a system is developed to obtain and analyze multisource data including precise positioning and visual information, and a solution is proposed for efficient processing of traffic accidents. © 2018 by the authors.

Asymmetric Multicore Processors (AMPs) are a special case of HMPs where different kinds of cores share the same instruction set, but offer different power-performance trade-offs. Due to the computational-power difference between these cores, finding an optimal hardware configuration for executing a given parallel program is quite challenging. An inherent difficulty in this problem stems from the fact that the original program is written for SMPs. This challenge is exacerbated by the interplay of several configuration parameters that are allowed to be changed in AMPs. In this work, we propose a probabilistic method named to choose the best available hardware configuration for a given parallel program. Selection of a configuration is guided by a user-provided run-time property such as energy-delay-product (EDP) and aspires to optimize the property in choosing a configuration. The core part of our probabilistic method relies on identifying the behavior of various program constructs in different classes of CPU cores in the AMP, and how it influences the cost function of choice. We implement the proposed technique in a compiler which automatically transforms a code optimized for SMP to run efficiently over an AMP, eliding requirement of any user annotations. Transforms the same source program for different hardware configurations based on different user requirement. We evaluate the efficiency of our method for three different run-time properties: execution time, energy consumption, and EDP, in NAS Parallel Benchmarks for OpenMP. Our experimental evaluation shows that achieves an average of 65, 28, and 57 percent improvement over baseline HMP scheduling while optimizing for energy, execution time, and EDP, respectively. © 2015 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer hardware; Cost functions; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Parallel processing systems; Program compilers; Scheduling; Shape memory effect; Asymmetric multicore; big.LITTLE; Compiler optimizations; Hardware configurations; Instruction set; Multi-core processing; Power demands; Processor scheduling; Multicore programming","Asymmetric multicore processors; big:LITTLE; compiler optimization; optimal hardware configuration; scheduling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041213131"

Various middlewares have been developed in cyber-physical systems to collect, aggregate, correlate, and translate system monitoring data. Existing middleware solutions are normally highly customized, which face several challenges due to the highly dynamic and harsh production environments. The data generated by sensors can only be shared by specific applications, which prevents the reusability of sensors. Moreover, the lack of uniform access to sensors causes high cost and low efficiency in application development. To address these issues, a resource-oriented middleware architecture called ROMiddleware was proposed, and three key enabling technologies including heterogeneous sensor modeling and grouping, open application programming interfaces development, and token-based access right control mechanism have been developed. Under the guidance of the key enabling technologies, a prototype of ROMiddleware was implemented and its performance was evaluated. Finally, two applications were developed to stress the significance of ROMiddleware.

For example, client developers might need to adapt to functionalities, client systems might need to be adapted to a new API, and client users might need to adapt to a new user interface. The consequences of these changes are yet unclear: what proportion of the ecosystem might be expected to react, how long might it take for a change to diffuse in the ecosystem, do all clients react in the same way?

New design methods try to automate most designers tasks to bridge this gap. In addition, new Model of Computations (MoCs), as those dataflowbased, ease the expression of parallelism within applications, leading to higher designer productivity. Rapid prototyping design tools offer fast estimations of the soundness of design choices. A key step when prototyping an application is to have representative performance indicators to estimate the validity of those design choices. Such indicators can be obtained using hardware information, while new libraries, e.g., Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI), ease the access to such hardware information. In this work, PAPIFY toolbox is presented as a tool to perform automatic PAPI-based instrumentation of dynamic dataflow applications. It combines PAPIFY with a dataflow Y-chart based design framework, which is called PREESM, and its companion run-time reconfiguration manager, which is called Synchronous Parameterized and Interfaced Dataflow Embedded Runtime (SPiDER). PAPIFY toolbox accounts for an automatic code generator for static and dynamic applications, a dedicated library to manage the monitoring at run-time and two User Interfaces (UIs) to ease both the configuration and the analysis of the captured run-time information. Additionally, its main advantages are 1) its capability of adapting the monitoring according to the system status and 2) adaptation of the monitoring accordingly to application workload redistribution in run-time.

The three-parameter soil model eliminates the necessity of field testing to determine soil parameters such as reaction modulus and shear parameter. These parameters are calculated using an iterative procedure depending on the soil surface vertical deformation profile in the model. The soil and tower system are modeled in SAP2000 structural analysis program using a computing tool coded in MATLAB. The tool provides a two-way data transfer between SAP2000 and MATLAB with the help of Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) feature of SAP2000. The response spectrum analyses of the tower system with circular V-shaped supporting columns and annular raft foundation on elastic soil are conducted thanks to the coded tool. The shell and column forces and displacements are presented for different soil conditions and fixed raft base condition to investigate the effects of soil-structure interaction. Numerical results indicate that the flexibility of soil foundation leads to an increase in displacements but a decrease in shell membrane and column forces. Therefore, it can be stated that the consideration of soil-structure interaction in the seismic response analysis of the cooling tower system provides an economical design process. © 2018 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cooling; Cooling towers; Data transfer; Finite element method; MATLAB; Seismic design; Seismic response; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Spectrum analysis; Flexibility of soil; Foundation modeling; Open application programming interface; Response spectrum analysis; Seismic response analysis; Soil-Structure Interaction effects; Supporting columns; Vertical deformation; Soil testing","Finite element analysis; Hyperbolic cooling tower; Open application programming interface; Response spectrum analysis; Three-parameter foundation model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057466865"

To accelerate the distribution of the standard a reference implementation is indispensable. However, the implementation of such a framework has to overcome several non-trivial challenges. First, the high level of complexity of the underlying standard must be reflected in the software design. An efficient implementation has to consider the limited resources of the underlying hardware. Moreover, the frameworks purpose of realizing a distributed system demands a high degree of reliability of the framework itself and its internal mechanisms. Additionally, a framework must provide an easy-to-use and fail-safe application programming interface (API). In this work, we address these challenges by discussing suitable software engineering principles and practical coding guidelines. A descriptive model is developed that identifies key strategies.

The need for efficient or real-time simulations requires high-fidelity techniques and formulations that should significantly minimize computational time. Parallel computing is one of the approaches to achieve this objective. This paper presents a novel index-3 divide-and-conquer algorithm for efficient multibody dynamics simulations that elegantly handles multibody systems in generalized topologies through the application of the augmented Lagrangian method. The proposed algorithm exploits a redundant set of absolute coordinates. The trapezoidal integration rule is embedded into the formulation and a set of nonlinear equations need to be solved every time instant. Consequently, the Newton–Raphson iterative scheme is applied to find the system coordinates and joint constraint loads in an efficient and highly parallelizable manner. Two divide-and-conquer-based mass-orthogonal projections are performed then to circumvent the effect of constraint violation errors at the velocity and acceleration level. Sample open- and closed-loop multibody system test cases are investigated in the paper to confirm the validity of the approach. Challenging simulations of multibody systems featuring long kinematic chains are also performed in the work to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm. The details of OpenMP-based parallel implementation on an eight-core shared memory computer are presented in the text and the parallel performance results are extensively discussed. Significant speedups are obtained for the simulations of small- to large-scale multibody open-loop systems. The mentioned features make the proposed algorithm a good general purpose approach for high-fidelity, efficient or real-time multibody dynamics simulations. © 2018, The Author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Chains; Computation theory; Computer aided engineering; Constrained optimization; Kinematics; Lagrange multipliers; Nonlinear equations; Parallel processing systems; Divide-and-conquer algorithm; Long chains; Mass-orthogonal projections; Multi-body dynamic; Real time simulations; Trapezoidal rules; Iterative methods","Divide-and-conquer algorithm; Long chain simulations; Mass-orthogonal projections; Multibody dynamics; Parallel computing; Real-time simulations; Trapezoidal rule","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055732605"

According to the characteristics of IoT, it can provide rich services for the terminal user. However, the centralized cloud computing-based storage architecture in IoT faces many challenges, such as data security, identity privacy, and high latency. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an IoT network storage architecture based on mobile edge computing, which not only achieves low-latency message response and computation offloading of the terminal user but also preserves identity-privacy of the terminal user. Afterward, we presented a novel non-interactive pairing-free ID-based proxy re-signature scheme (ID-PRS), which is a kernel technique to construct the aforementioned storage architecture. Compared with most of proxy re-signature schemes constructed based on traditional public-key-infrastructure, the proposed scheme avoids expensive pairing operation and intricate certificate-maintenance. And it is demonstrated to be provably secure under the classic security assumptions: integer factoring problem and the RSA assumption. Finally, in contrast to the other two ID-PRS schemes, the proposed ID-PRS scheme has more advantages in terms of security, functionability, and computation costs. Thus, it is very suitable to be applied to the resource-constrained mobile users. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Authentication; Computer architecture; Digital storage; Edge computing; Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Computation offloading; Factoring problem; free-pairing; Integer factorization problem; Internet of thing (IOT); non-interactive; Public key infrastructure; Storage architectures; Internet of things","free-pairing; ID-PRS; integer factorization problem; mobile edge computing; non-interactive","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065187237"

This paper proposes an objective and accurate criterion to characterize leakage resistance of casing connections in axisymmetric FE simulation. The criterion is based on stab flank contact pressures and stab flank engaged length parameters. The criterion is tested in application to API 8 Round LTC connections (5 ½ J55 14lb/ft), and confronted with test results. Leakage envelopes are obtained considering make-up torque and tensile axial loads. The influence of taper on connection sealability is also investigated.

This study proposes a two-stage mesh generation approach to reduce the meshing cost and introduces a hybrid parallelization scheme for atmospheric fluid simulations. The meshing approach splits mesh generation into two stages: in the first stage, the meshing parameters that uniquely determine the mesh distribution are extracted, and in the second stage, a mesh system is generated in parallel via an in situ approach using the parameters obtained in the initialization phase of the simulation. The proposed two-stage approach is flexible since an arbitrary number of processes can be selected at run time.

Already, SDN has realized some extraordinary use cases outside of academia with companies, such as Google, AT&T, Microsoft, and many others. However, SDN still presents many research and operational challenges for government, industry, and campus networks. Because of these challenges, many SDN solutions have developed in an ad hoc manner that are not easily adopted by other organizations.

Based on the application program interface (API) techniques of specialized third-party software, the software integrates B-spline fitting and modeling of airfoil and complex curves, modeling of the fuselage and wings, a high-lift system design, the automatic generation of a structured grid, and high-fidelity CFD code based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. First, the geometry of the fuselage and wing is parametrically generated by lofting with control curves, and then the initial graphics exchange specification (IGES) format geometry is exported to an automatic grid generation module. Finally, the structured grid file is exported to the CFD solver for aerodynamic analysis. The NACA0012 airfoil and DLR-F6 FX2B wing-body model that was published at a workshop are selected for software validation. The cruise configuration model (with nacelle, wingtip, and empennage designed manually) of a 150 seat airliner designed using this software was subsequently used for a high-lift aerodynamic/mechanical integrated design and kinematic simulation.

Although many brain extraction methods have been proposed in the literature, most of them are either laborious or time consuming, and lack of instant visualization. This leads to a time lag between image acquisition and comprehensive visualization. Especially for intraoperative image based neurosurgery navigation, the time lag from image acquisition to brain visualization should be reduced as much as possible. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end fast brain extraction and visualization framework. The input is a T1-weighted MR volume and the output is comprehensive brain visualization. An improved brain extraction tool (BET) algorithm is proposed to evolve a 3D active mesh model to fit the brain surface in the 3D image. Then the brain mask is generated per slice using a polygon fill algorithm. At last, a ray-casting volume rendering algorithm is used to visualize the brain surface with the help of the generated mask. All the operations are performed using the modern OpenGL pipelines running on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets and one clinical dataset to compare our method with five state-of-the-art methods including the original BET in terms of segmentation accuracy and time cost. Our method achieved mean Dice coefficients of 96.8%, 97.1%, 98.5% and mean time cost of 361 ms, 341 ms, 502 ms on the three datasets, outperforming all the other methods. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics equipment; Extraction; Flow visualization; Graphics processing unit; Image acquisition; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance; Neurosurgery; Pipelines; Program processors; Visualization; Volume rendering; Active contours; Brain extraction; Brain extraction tools; Brain segmentation; Dice coefficient; Segmentation accuracy; Visualization framework; Volume rendering algorithm; Image segmentation","active contour; Brain extraction; image segmentation; neurosurgery; visualization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074683018"

Over the last two decades, many clinical NLP systems were developed in both academia and industry. However, nearly all existing systems are restricted to specific clinical settings mainly because they were developed for and tested with specific datasets, and they often fail to scale up. Therefore, using existing NLP systems for one's own clinical purposes requires substantial resources and long-term time commitments for customization and testing. Moreover, the maintenance is also troublesome and time-consuming. This research presents a lightweight approach for building clinical NLP systems with limited resources. Following the design science research approach, we propose a lightweight architecture which is designed to be composable, extensible, and configurable. It takes NLP as an external component which can be accessed independently and orchestrated in a pipeline via web APIs. To validate its feasibility, we developed a web-based prototype for clinical concept extraction with six well-known NLP APIs and evaluated it on three clinical datasets. In comparison with available benchmarks for the datasets, three high F1 scores (0.861, 0.724, and 0.805) were obtained from the evaluation. It also gained a low F1 score (0.373) on one of the tests, which probably is due to the small size of the test dataset. The development and evaluation of the prototype demonstrates that our approach has a great potential for building effective clinical NLP systems with limited resources. © 2019 Zhengru Shen et al.","Clinical Trials as Topic; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Machine Learning; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing; Obesity; Patient Discharge; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Reproducibility of Results; Application programming interfaces (API); Clinical research; Statistical tests; drug; Clinical settings; Concept extraction; Design-science researches; Existing systems; External components; Lightweight architecture; NAtural language processing; Web-based prototype; article; clinical evaluation; extraction; feasibility study; natural language processing; pipeline; clinical trial (topic); data mining; factual database; false positive result; hospital discharge; human; machine learning; medical informatics; natural language processing; obesity; procedures; reproducibility; Natural language processing systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071693853"

A standard PC can be turned into an IPU relatively easily with the help of readily available computer vision libraries, but the end result will not be portable, and may be costly. Similarly, one can use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) as the base for an IPU, but they are expensive and require hardware-level programming. Finally, general purpose embedded hardware tends to be under-powered and difficult to develop for due to poor support for running advanced software. In recent years a new option has surfaced: single-board computers (SBCs). These generally inexpensive embedded devices would be attractive as a platform on which to develop IPUs due to their inherent portability and good compatibility with existing computer vision (CV) software. However, whether their performance is sufficient for real-time image processing has thus far remained an open question. Most SBCs (especially the ultra-low-cost ones which we target) do not offer CUDA/OpenCL support which makes it difficult to port GPU-based CV applications. In order to utilize the full power of the SBCs, their GPUs need to be used. In our attempts at doing this, we have observed that the CV algorithms which an IPU uses have to be re-designed according to the OpenGL support available on these devices. This work presents a framework where a selection of CV algorithms have been designed in a way that they optimize performance on SBCs while still maintaining portability across devices which offer OpenGL ES 2.0 support. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates an IPU based on a representative SBC (namely the Raspberry Pi) along with two CV applications backed by it. The robustness of the applications as well as the performance of the IPU are evaluated to show that SPCs can be used to build IPUs capable of producing accurate data in real time. This opens the possibilities of large scale economically deployment of vision system especially in remote and barren lands.

Although they represent significant efforts for helping APIs understanding, the client applications are not available for either newly released APIs libraries or APIs that are not widely used. In this paper, a non-client-based approach for frequent usage patterns identification and documentation is proposed. The approach incorporates hierarchical clustering algorithm and API's source code information. An experimental evaluation is conducted using four widely used APIs.

Our investigations revealed that the microstructure after the rough rolling stage consist of coarse grained ferrite and bainite clusters, while the specimens finished rolled at 600 °C and 700 °C consist mainly of elongated ferrites and a well recrystallized polygonal shaped ferrite grains. EBSD investigations confirmed that dynamic recovery was dominant during the rough rolling stage; whereas a partial recrystallization and a well recrystallized structure were observed during finish rolling at 600 °C and 700 °C respectively. X-ray macro-texture measurement showed that the intensity of the desired γ-fiber texture is dependent on the finish rolling temperature. The finish rolling treatments lowered the fractions of the Goss, Brass, S and Copper texture components. However, higher fractions of the Goss {001}〈100〉 brass ({110}〈112〉), S ({123}〈634〉) and Copper ({112}〈111〉) were observed in steels rolled at 600 °C finish rolling temperature. Strong texture inhomogeneity during warm rolling was observed. The γ-fiber is seen to be better formed at the mid thickness compared to the surface. Most grains at the mid thickness were oriented in the {111}‖ND and {001}‖ND at both finish rolling temperatures. The finish rolling temperature played a key role in the development of texture such that the recrystallization of grains in steel finish rolled at 700 °C favoured the development of the γ-fiber texture. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Application programming interfaces (API); Brass; Copper; Crystallization; Dynamic recrystallization; Ferrite; Gamma rays; Microstructural evolution; Pipelines; Steel pipe; Textures; EBSD; Electron back scatter diffraction; Finish rolling temperature; Partial recrystallization; Pipeline steel; Texture inhomogeneity; TMCP; Warm rolling; Steel fibers","EBSD; Pipeline steel; Recrystallization; Texture; TMCP; Warm-rolling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057759663"

Current categorization methods in app markets mainly rely on manual operation. Existing approaches for automatic Android app categorization suffer from low efficiency and low accuracy due to insufficient analysis of features, or inappropriate choice of features. This will mislead users to download unrelated apps and is not conducive to market stability maintenance. In this paper, we propose DroidARA, an efficient automatic categorization method for Android apps based on API relationships analysis. Considering that the app category can be characterized by API relationships which represent the combinations and links among APIs, we design a complete system to generate API call graphs, extract the API relationships information, transform them into feature vectors and train the classifier. Firstly, the API calls are obtained through static analysis to generate API call graphs that contain the relationships among APIs. A novel matrix structure as well as related algorithm are designed to extract the API relationships information from API call graphs. After that, the matrix is transformed into vector according to two feature selection methods we designed for strengthening the use of effective information in the API relationships. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then trained with labeled samples of such feature vectors. To validate the feasibility of DroidARA, we conduct several categorization experiments on 19949 real apps of Google Play. The results demonstrate that DroidARA can achieve an average 88.9% accuracy in categorizing the apps into 24 categories, which outperforms existing methods by 18.5%. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Classification (of information); Commerce; Neural networks; Static analysis; Android; API relationship; Automatic categorization; categorization; Categorization methods; Convolutional neural network; Feature selection methods; Relationship analysis; Android (operating system)","Android; API relationship; categorization; static analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078314384"

Thus, different levels of assurance are required by different tasks in terms of real-time performance. As the computational demands of real-time tasks increase, tasks may require internal parallelism in order to complete within stringent deadlines. In this paper, we consider the problem of mixed-criticality scheduling of parallel real-time tasks and propose a novel mixed-criticality federated scheduling (MCFS) algorithm for parallel tasks modeled by a directed acyclic graph. MCFS is based on federated intuition for scheduling parallel real-time tasks. It strategically assigns cores and virtual deadlines to tasks to achieve good schedulability. For high-utilization tasks (utilization ≥ 1), we prove that MCFS provides a capacity augmentation bound of 2+2 and (5+5)/2 for dual- and multi-criticality, respectively. We show that MCFS has a capacity augmentation bound of 11 m/ (3 m- 3) for dual-criticality systems with both high- and low-utilization tasks. For high-utilization tasks, we further provide a MCFS-Improve algorithm that has the same bound but can admit many more task sets in practice. Results of numerical experiments show that MCFS-Improve significantly improves over MCFS for many different workload settings. We also present an implementation of a MCFS runtime system in Linux that supports parallel programs written in OpenMP. Our implementation provides graceful degradation and recovery features.

The comprehensive LBS platforms which meet the demands such as multi-precision level, massive user and desirable scalability, become critical for the public applications. In this paper, a new high precision LBS architecture based on GNSS CORS network is presented. The platform is deployed in the cloud computational environment. It is divided into two parts: data processing and allocation system individually. The virtual grids differential corrections are involved to optimize the real-time CORS stations data processing. Besides, the API/SDK module is introduced as a new service mode, which integrates the meter, decimeter, centimeter level LBS applications, respectively realized by the coordinates, pseudo range and carrier phase differential. With the daily needs of HNCORS network, the platform 'SoBDS' is established. The experiments for decimeter level example shows that, the platform could support one million users, and it is compatible and scalable.

New services for a specific set of IoT application programming interfaces (APIs) of diversified industry verticals can efficiently be deployed. As the set of APIs based on the IoT continues to thrive, reliance on the underlying cloud computing to deliver real-time and context-based services is also prominent in MEC. Due to the increased level of mutual interference of IoT APIs, the complexities are also multiplied. The set of IoT APIs competes for available resources within heterogeneous clouds (HCs). It is further aggravated by the unprecedented number of connected devices. We are presenting a cognitive agent (CA)-oriented approach to proactively subordinate IoT APIs with HCs. This paper contributes to establish an empirical multi-agent cognitive architecture framework (MCAF) for continuous transition of IoT APIs. We identified an adaptable composition method and a classification technique for CAs during this research effort. It introduces rationalization of CA creation, migration, and control. The approach achieves transparency in the heterogeneity and distribution of IoT APIs. It provides dynamism of cloud computing environments.

FEM×DEM has proven to be an effective way to treat real-scale engineering problems by embedding constitutive laws numerically obtained using discrete elements into a standard finite element framework. This proposed paper focuses on some numerical open issues of the method. Given the nonlinearity of the problem, Newton's method is required. The standard full Newton method is modified by adopting operators different from the consistent tangent matrix and by developing ad-hoc solution strategies. The efficiency of several existing operators is compared, and a new and original strategy is proposed, which is shown to be numerically more efficient than the existing propositions. Furthermore, a shared memory parallelization framework using OpenMP directives is introduced. The combination of these enhancements allows to overcome the FEM×DEM computational limitations, thus making the approach competitive with classical FEM in terms of stability and computational cost.

This also refers to the emergence of challenges in Requirements Elicitation techniques, approaches, and tools while performing them. Particularly, in the area of Requirements Engineering for software development, a number of techniques and approaches have been observed in literature but for mobile application development, which is different from the traditional software development, has not been discussed much in past studies. Short development cycle, device limitations, and less development time for mobile application development are some of the issues to which there is no 'silver bullet' available. Therefore, the Requirement Analysts are in dire need of defined guidelines for Requirement Elicitation in mobile application development. With this study, we aim to provide a detailed overview of Requirements Elicitation techniques and its challenges. We have conducted a systematic literature review by surveying 4507 initial and 36 primary studies. A comprehensive set of 22 elicitation techniques were measured based on quality assessment criteria, including time and cost factors, resource effectiveness, and domain understanding. Furthermore, the challenges in Requirements Elicitation were also grouped into eight different categories based on their applicability.

Simulation of sonar operation allows evaluating algorithms and control systems without going to the real underwater environment; that reduces the costs and risks of in-field experiments. This paper tackles with the problem of real-time underwater imaging sonar simulation by using the OpenGL shading language chain on GPU. Our proposed system is able to simulate two main types of acoustic devices: mechanical scanning imaging sonars and forward-looking sonars. The underwater scenario simulation is performed based on three frameworks: (i) OpenSceneGraph reproduces the ocean visual effects, (ii) Gazebo deals with physical forces, and (iii) the Robot Construction Kit controls the sonar in underwater environments. Our system exploits the rasterization pipeline in order to simulate the sonar devices, which are simulated by means of three parameters: the pulse distance, the echo intensity and the sonar field-of-view, being all calculated over observable objects shapes in the 3D rendered scene. Sonar-intrinsic operational parameters, speckle noise and object material properties are also considered as part of the acoustic image. Our evaluation demonstrated that the proposed system is able to operate close to or faster than the real-world devices. Also, our method generates visually realistic sonar images when compared with real-world sonar images of the same scenes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer simulation languages; Graphics processing unit; Rasterization; Sonar; Underwater imaging; Gpu-based; Robot construction; Sensor data; Sonar imaging; Underwater robotics; Underwater acoustics","GPU-based processing; Robot construction kit (Rock); Simulated sensor data; Sonar imaging; Underwater robotics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028715072"

However, high-quality building models do not happen by accident, but rather because of a managed process that involves several participants from different disciplines and backgrounds. Throughout this process, the different priorities of design modelers often result in conflicts that can negatively impact project outcomes. To prevent such unwanted outcomes from occurring, the modeling process needs to be effectively managed. This effective management requires an ability to closely monitor the modeling process and correctly measure the modelers’ performance. Nevertheless, existing methods of performance monitoring in building design practices lack an objective measurement system to quantify modeling progress. The widespread utilization of BIM tools presents a unique opportunity to retrieve granular design process data and conduct accurate performance measurements. This research improves upon previous efforts by presenting a novel application programming interface (API)-enabled approach to (a) automatically collect detailed model development data directly from BIM software packages in real-time, and (b) efficiently calculate several modeling performance measures during schematic and design development phases of building projects. These indicators can be used to properly arrange modeling teams in the quest for high-quality building models. The specific objectives of this study to examine the feasibility of a proposed automated design performance measurement framework, and to identify optimal modeling team configurations using empirical performance information. A passive data recording approach allows for the real-time capture of comprehensive user interface (UI) interaction and model element modification events. The proposed framework is implemented as an Autodesk Revit plugin. Next, an experiment is conducted to capture data using the developed Revit plugin. Experiment participants’ individual production rates are estimated to establish the validity of the proposed approach to identify the optimal design team configuration. The presented approach uses the earliest due date (EDD) sequencing rule in combination with the critical path method (CPM) to calculate the maximum lateness for different design team arrangements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Product design; Project management; Turnaround time; User interfaces; Accurate performance; Building Information Model - BIM; Data analytics; Empirical performance; Modeling team; Objective measurement; Performance measurements; Performance monitoring; Architectural design","Application programming interface; BIM; Data analytics; Modeling team; Performance measurement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047019369"

However, their extremely long resolution time seriously delays the working schedules of developers. Despite researchers have investigated how to automatically resolve API-related questions by recommending correct APIs for them, there is still much room for additional improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of recommending APIs for API-related questions based on API specifications and historical resolved questions (RASH). Given a new API-related question, RASH recommends APIs for it guided by two central observations. First, the more lexically similar the functional description in an API's specification is to the new question, the more likely that the API can resolve the new question. Second, the APIs that have resolved more historical similar questions can also help to resolve the new question. To verify the effectiveness of RASH, we construct and publish a corpus containing 1234 API-related questions with their correct APIs from Stack Overflow, and conduct extensive experiments over it. The experimental results show that RASH is relatively stable and robust to a different quality of questions. In addition, RASH hits nearly 70% correct APIs and outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 15.64% when recommending 15 APIs for each question. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Correlation methods; Information retrieval; Libraries; Recommender systems; Robustness (control systems); Scheduling; Search engines; Specifications; API specifications; Central observations; Delays; Java; Resolution time; Stack overflow; State-of-the-art approach; Computer systems programming","Application programming interfaces; information retrieval; recommendation system; stack overflow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037647094"

As we look toward the future of OpenMP, we immediately see further evolution of the support for that range of parallelization strategies and the addition of direct support for debugging and performance analysis tools. Looking beyond the next major release of the specification of the OpenMP API, we expect the specification eventually to include support for more parallelization strategies and to embrace closer integration into its Fortran, C and, in particular, C++ base languages, which will likely require the API to adopt additional programming abstractions. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); C++ (programming language); Computer architecture; Computer science; Information management; Mathematical programming; Memory architecture; Parallel architectures; Parallel programming; Program debugging; Specifications; Accelerator architectures; Computers and information processing; Memory management; Multi-core processing; Multi-threading; Parallel processing; Multicore programming","Accelerator architectures; computer architecture; computer science; computers and information processing; memory management; multicore processing; multithreading; parallel architectures; parallel processing; parallel programming; programming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051664821"

This research thus proposes a rule-based automated building information model (BIM) approach for designing boarding layout and planning material sheet cutting, resulting in practically feasible solutions with minimal material waste. In this research, object-based computer-processable layout design rules are comprehensively formalised based on trades’ know-how. On this basis, rule-based design algorithms are further developed and integrated with mathematical algorithms in order to automatically generate design and planning alternatives while minimising material waste. Rich information in the BIM is leveraged to automate the rule-based boarding design and planning. A prototype system is developed based on Autodesk Revit via Application Programming Interface. A typical wood-framed residential building is used as a case study to test the developed prototype system. The results show the proposed approach successfully preserves the know-how of senior trades people while also minimising material waste in automating the boarding design and planning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Behavioral research; Buildings; Commerce; Computer systems programming; Decision making; Design; Housing; Information theory; Software prototyping; Technology transfer; Automated buildings; Building Information Model - BIM; Building Information Modelling; Design and planning; Feasible solution; Mathematical algorithms; Residential building; Rule-based design; Architectural design","Boarding design and planning; Construction-centric BIM; Enriched information extraction; Rule-based design algorithms; Trades’ know-how","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041381942"

In this paper, a user-level disk prefetching framework, called iFetcher, is introduced to hide this delay in Linux-based operating systems. This employs an inode-notification (inotify) application programming interface (API), which provides an efficient method of tracing operations in a Linux file system, and reports these events to applications in real time. During an initial training run, iFetcher traces the pattern with which data are read by an application. Subsequently, it searches the areas directly ahead of passages where it is requested that a lot of data are read, and locates events that can be used to trigger preloading. When the application is run again and a trigger event is reported (by the inotify API), the corresponding data are read into the page cache prior to actual demand. iFetcher has a low overhead, because disk reads are only need to be monitored during training. Furthermore, it does not require any modifications to the Linux kernel, because it runs at the user level. Five benchmark applications were run on a PC using a solid-state drive, and results demonstrated that iFetcher reduced the launch times by up to 41% and post-launch data loading times by up to 9%. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; Computer systems programming; Correlation methods; Digital storage; File organization; Linux; Monitoring; Sorting; iFetcher; inode notify; Kernel; Loading time; Prefetching; Loading","iFetcher; inode notify; launch times; Linux; loading times; user-level prefetching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052558747"

Cyber criminals exploit this spur in user engagement levels to spread malicious content that compromises system reputation, causes financial losses and degrades user experience. In this paper, we collect and characterize a dataset of 4.4 million public posts generated on Facebook during 17 news-making events (natural calamities, sports, terror attacks, etc.) over a 16-month time period. From this dataset, we filter out two sets of malicious posts, one using URL blacklists and another using human annotations. Our observations reveal some characteristic differences between malicious posts obtained from the two methodologies, thus demanding a twofold filtering process for a more complete and robust filtering system. We empirically confirm the need for this twofold filtering approach by cross-validating supervised learning models obtained from the two sets of malicious posts. These supervised learning models include Naive Bayesian, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine-based models. Based on this learning, we implement Facebook Inspector, a REST API-based browser plug-in for identifying malicious Facebook posts in real time. Facebook Inspector uses class probabilities obtained from two independent supervised learning models based on a Random Forest classifier to identify malicious posts in real time. These supervised learning models are based on a feature set comprising of 44 features and achieve an accuracy of over 80% each, using only publicly available features. During the first 9 months of its public deployment (August 2015–May 2016), Facebook Inspector processed 0.97 million posts at an average response time of 2.6 s per post and was downloaded over 2500 times. We also evaluate Facebook Inspector in terms of performance and usability to identify further scope for improvement. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Application programming interfaces (API); Decision trees; E-learning; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Losses; Real time systems; Signal detection; Supervised learning; Characteristic difference; Class probabilities; Facebook; Filtering process; Malicious content; On-line social networks; Random forest classifier; Real-time detection; Social networking (online)","Facebook; Machine learning; Malicious content; Real-time system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018571396"

We develop the first theory of distributed multiparty session types (MPST) to support parameterised protocols with indexed rolesÐour framework statically infers the different kinds of participants induced by a protocol definition as role variants, and produces decoupled endpoint projections of the protocol onto each variant. This enables safe MPST-based programming of the parameterised endpoints in distributed settings: each endpoint can be implemented separately by different programmers, using different techniques (or languages). We prove the decidability of role variant inference and well-formedness checking, and the correctness of projection. We implement our theory as a toolchain for programming such role-parametric MPST protocols in Go. Our approach is to generate API families of lightweight, protocol- and variant-specific type wrappers for I/O. The APIs ensure a well-typed Go endpoint program (by native Go type checking) will perform only compliant I/O actions w.r.t. the source protocol. We leverage the abstractions of MPST to support the specification and implementation of Go applications involving multiple channels, possibly over mixed transports (e.g., Go channels, TCP), and channel passing via a unified programming interface. We evaluate the applicability and run-time performance of our generated APIs using microbenchmarks and real-world applications. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Message passing; Specifications; Communication structures; Distributed programming; Indexed roles; Multiparty sessions; Multiple channels; Programming interface; Run-time performance; Safe programming; Application programming interfaces (API)","Distributed programming; Go; Indexed roles; Multiparty session types","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120138942"

With an increasing number of finite elements of ANCF to mesh flexible bodies, however, the computation cost will become extremely high. To improve the computational efficiency of ANCF for a large-scaled flexible multibody system, a systematic method is proposed in this study for the model order reduction based on the proper orthogonal decomposition and the Galerkin projection. At first, an approach for the selection of reduced constraint equations is proposed to deal with the singularity of the coefficient matrix of the Reduced-Order Model (ROM). Then, the computation of the reduced stiffness matrix and generalized force vector of the ROM are parallelized via the OpenMP directives. Afterwards, two parametric approaches are presented to make the ROM be adaptive to the change of system parameters. One is the interpolation approach of reduced-order basis vectors on a manifold to obtain the parametric ROM, and the other is the fast-to-slow ROM approach via the reduced-order basis vectors extracted from the fast dynamic responses to simulate slow dynamic responses. Finally, four numerical examples are given to validate the efficacy of the proposed method for the dynamic simulations of both rigid and flexible multibody systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computational efficiency; Dynamic response; Interpolation; Numerical methods; Absolute nodal coordinate formulation; Absolute nodal coordinate formulations (ANCF); ANCF; Fast dynamic response; Flexible multibody systems; Model order reduction; Parametric modeling; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Stiffness matrix","ANCF; Fast-to-slow ROM; Flexible multibody systems; Parameter interpolation; Parametric model order reduction; Proper orthogonal decomposition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025087587"

Traditionally, MEP coordination has been conducted based on overlaying 2D drawings from different trades to detect functional and spatial interferences between MEP systems. Such coordination is time consuming and of low efficiency. Recently, the advent and development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) have significantly changed this process by affording a visual and collaborative manner. However, it still needs much manual work and many rounds of coordination as the conventional 2D design was still used. Therefore, this paper proposes a well-defined approach based on BIM to improve the workflow and automate the process by developing an MEP rule-based automated engine using Revit Application Programming Interface (API) tool. The engine is developed primarily to help analyse available ceiling zone for MEP elements in the first phase and then extended to facilitate rule-based routing in the second phase. The proposed approach is verified and validated by an illustrative example, followed by a real-life MEP design case. The result shows that with the help of the proposed approach, clashes and the number of coordination iteration are reduced substantially. © 2019 The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Engines; Fire protection; Plumbing; Building Information Modelling; Coordination process; Fire protection system; MEP Coordination; MEP deign; Rule based; Spatial coordination; Spatial interference; Architectural design","Automation; BIM; MEP coordination; MEP deign; Rule-based routing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068225900"

In this paper, a navigable flow condition simulation system is developed to provide useful information for waterway management and shipping safety. To improve the simulation speed of 2-D hydrodynamic model, an explicit finite volume method and OpenMP are used to realize parallel computing. Two mesh schemes and two computing platforms are adopted to study the parallel model’s performance in the Yangtze River, China. The results show that the parallel model achieves dramatic acceleration, with a maximum speedup ratio of 34.94×. The parallel model can determine the flow state of the navigable channel in about 4 min, efficiency is further improved by a flow simulation scheme database.

The proposed model is composed of several connected coil springs in series. The sum of torsion deformation on every coil is equivalent to the soft tissue surface deformation. The calculation of the model is simple because the method for calculating the torsion deformation for each coil spring is the same. The virtual surgery simulation system is established on PHANTOM OMNI haptic device based on the OpenGL 3D graphic interface and VC++ software, and it is used to simulate the torsion deformation of virtual legs and arms.

Applications in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are taking center stage in HPC, which is driving demand for increasing compute resources per node which in turn is pushing bandwidth requirement between the compute nodes. New system design paradigms exist where deploying a system with more than one high performance IO device per node provides benefits. The number of I/O devices connected to the HPC node can be increased with PCIe switches and hence some of the HPC nodes are designed to include PCIe switches to provide a large number of PCIe slots. With multiple IO devices per node, application programmers are forced to consider HPC process affinity to not only compute resources but extend this to include IO devices. Mapping of process to processor cores and the closest IO device(s) increases complexity due to three way mapping and varying HPC node architectures. While operating systems perform reasonable mapping of process to processor core(s), they lack the application developer's knowledge of process workflow and optimal IO resource allocation when more than one IO device is attached to the compute node. This paper is an extended version of our work published in [1]. Our previous work provided solution for IO device affinity choices by abstracting the device selection algorithm from HPC applications. In this paper, we extend the affinity solution to enable OpenFabric Interfaces (OFI) which is a generic HPC API designed as part of the OpenFabrics Alliance that enables wider HPC programming models and applications supported by various HPC fabric vendors. We present a solution for IO device affinity choices by abstracting the device selection algorithm from HPC applications. MPI continues to be the dominant programming model for HPC and hence we provide evaluation with MPI based micro benchmarks. Our solution is then extended to OpenFabric Interfaces which supports other HPC programming models such as SHMEM, GASNet, and UPC. We propose a solution to solve NUMA issues at the lower level of the software stack that forms the runtime for MPI and other programming models independent of HPC applications. Our experiments are conducted on a two node system where each node consists of two socket Intel Xeon servers, attached with up to four Intel Omni-Path fabric devices connected over PCIe. The performance benefits seen by applications by affinitizing processes with best possible network device is evident from the results where we notice up to 40 percent improvement in uni-directional bandwidth, 48 percent bi-directional bandwidth, 32 percent improvement in latency measurements, and up to 40 percent improvement in message rate with OSU benchmark suite. We also extend our evaluation to include OFI operations and an MPI benchmark used for Genome assembly. With OFI Remote Memory Access (RMA) operations we see a bandwidth improvement of 32 percent for firead and 22 percent with fiwrite operations, and also latency improvement of 15 percent for firead and 14 percent for fiwrite. K-mer MMatching Interface HASH benchmark shows an improvement of up to 25 percent while using local network device versus using a network device connected to remote Xeon socket. © 2015 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Fabrics; Learning systems; Mapping; Topology; Application developers; Application programmers; Bandwidth requirement; High performance computing; High performance computing (HPC); Infiniband; NUMA; Performance; Application programming interfaces (API)","Fabric; high performance computing; infiniband; MPI; NUMA; OFI; performance; process affinity; topology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053593138"

To support the interconnection and interoperability between heterogeneous IoT systems, the availability of standardized, open application programming interfaces (APIs) is one of the key features of common software platforms for IoT devices, gateways, and servers. In this paper, we present a standardized way of extending previously-existing WSNs towards IoT systems, building the world of the Web of Things (WoT). Based on the oneM2M software platforms developed in the previous project, we introduce a well-designed open API scheme and device-specific thing adaptation software (TAS) enabling WSN elements, such as a wireless sensor node, to be accessed in a standardized way on a global scale. Three pilot services are implemented (i.e., a WiFi-enabled smart flowerpot, voice-based control for ZigBee-connected home appliances, and WiFi-connected AR.Drone control) to demonstrate the practical usability of the open API scheme and TAS modules. Full details on the method of integrating WSN elements into three example systems are described at the programming code level, which is expected to help future researchers in integrating their WSN systems in IoT platforms, such as oneM2M. We hope that the flexibly-deployable, easily-reusable common open API scheme and TAS-based integration method working with the oneM2M platforms will help the conventional WSNs in diverse industries evolve into the emerging WoT solutions. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer software reusability; Computer systems programming; Domestic appliances; Internet; Interoperability; Sensor nodes; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless sensor networks; World Wide Web; Zigbee; Integration method; Internet of thing (IOT); Network technologies; OneM2M; Open API; Open application programming interface; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor node; Internet of things","Internet of things; OneM2M; Open API; Web of things; Wireless sensor network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990947064"

If in such cases a fast prototyping of a coupled simulation environment is required, a partitioned setup using existing codes for each physical field is the optimal choice. As accurate models require also accurate numerics, multi-physics simulations typically use very high grid resolutions and, accordingly, are run on massively parallel computers. Here, we face the challenge to combine flexibility with parallel scalability and hardware efficiency. In this paper, we present the coupling tool preCICE which offers the complete coupling functionality required for a fast development of a multi-physics environment using existing, possibly black-box solvers. We hereby restrict ourselves to bidirectional surface coupling which is too expensive to be done via file communication, but in contrast to volume coupling still a candidate for distributed memory parallelism between the involved solvers.

The simulation results from several numerical examples using the modified DDA programme demonstrate that the Jacobi-PCG is a better iterative method for large-scale engineering computing and that adoptive parallel strategies can greatly enhance computational efficiency. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Computational efficiency; Computer aided engineering; Conjugate gradient method; Deformation; Efficiency; Jacobian matrices; Linear equations; Matrix algebra; Numerical methods; Parallel processing systems; Block conjugate gradients; Diagonal matrices; Discontinuous deformation analysis; Heterogeneous platforms; Large-scale engineering; Matrix-vector products; OpenMP; Parallel strategies; algorithm; data inversion; deformation; matrix; numerical model; parallel computing; Iterative methods","CPU-GPU; Discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA); Linear equation solver; OpenMP; Parallel computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958211636"

In order to obtain the statistical relationships and a suitable geometry, different heights of the detector and different lengths of the 1-D profiles of the sea surface were assumed using the OpenMP directives of CPU computing parallel. For this, a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian probability density function (pdf) for the sea surface slopes of the profile were considered, using a Rect and a Gaussian glitter function to model the geometry of the interaction of the sun on the sea profile. The curves have inflection points at different wind velocities on the sea surface for all the cases considered, where the results showed a similar behavior of the curves for both the glitter functions. Higher values for the variances of the intensities of the image using the Rect glitter function were found because the Gaussian glitter function contains less energy and a significant decrease in the values when the detector height increases. The behavior of the curves of variance depends on a large percentage of the angles of incidence. To apply a non-Gaussian pdf instead of a Gaussian pdf provides variance curves slightly smoothed but with similar values, so one of these pdfs can be used to represent both. The same occurs in the correlation function.

Among them, material deposition plan can frequently interrupt the AM process due to tool-path changes, tool start-stop and non-deposition time, which can be challenging during free-form part fabrication. In this paper, the layer geometries for both model and support structure are analyzed to identify the features that create change in deposition modality. First, the overhanging points on the part surface are identified using the normal vector direction of the model surface. A k-th nearest point algorithm is implemented to generate the 3d boundary support contour which is used to construct the support structure. Both model and support structures are sliced and contours are evaluated. The layer contour, plurality, concavity, number of contours, geometric shape, size and interior islands are considered to generate an AM deposition model. The proposed model is solved for minimizing the change in deposition modality by maximizing the continuity and connectivity in the material deposition plan. Both continuity and connectivity algorithms are implemented for model and support structure for free-form object. The proposed algorithm provides the optimum deposition direction that results in minimum number of tool-path segments and their connectivity while minimizing contour plurality effect. This information is stored as a generic digital file format named Part Attributable Motion (PAM). A common application program interface (API) platform is also proposed in this paper, which can access the PAM and generate machine readable file for different existing 3D printers. The proposed research is implemented on three free-form objects with complex geometry and parts are fabricated. Also, the build time is evaluated and the results are compared with the available 3d printing software. © 2016","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Copying; Deposition; Geometry; Ground supports; Manufacture; Application program interfaces; Build time; Connectivity algorithms; Contour plurality; Digital file formats; Optimal deposition direction; Part Attributable Motion (PAM); Process architecture; 3D printers","Additive manufacturing; Build time; Contour plurality; Optimal deposition direction; Part Attributable Motion (PAM)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993950067"

The engineering literature proposing novel algorithms, protocols and architectures for managing and processing multimedia information is currently overwhelming. However, most of these results do not arrive to applications due to the lack of simple and usable APIs. Interestingly, in this context in which APIs are the critical ingredient for reaching wide developer audiences, the scientific literature about multimedia APIs and their usability is scarce. In this paper we try to contribute to fill this gap by proposing the RTC Media API: a novel type of API designed with the aim of making simple for developers the use of latest trends in RTC multimedia including WebRTC, Video Content Analysis or Augmented Reality. We provide a specification of such API and discuss how it satisfies a set of design requirements including programming-language agnosticism, adaptation to cloud environments, support to multisensory multimedia, etc. After that, we describe an implementation of such an API that has been created in the context of the Kurento open source software project, and present a study evaluating the API usability performed in a group of more than 40 professional developers distributed worldwide. In the light of the obtained results, we conclude that the usability of the API is adequate across the main development activities (i.e. API learning, code creation and code maintenance), with an average usability score of 3.39 over 5 in a Likert scale, and that this result is robust with respect to developers’ profiles, cultures, professional experiences and preferred programming languages. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithms; Augmented reality; Computational linguistics; Computer systems programming; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Network architecture; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Usability engineering; Cognitive dimensions of notations; Media servers; Multimedia processing; Multimedia tool; Real-time multimedia communication; WebRTC; Application programming interfaces (API)","Application Programming Interfaces; Cognitive dimensions of notations; Media server; Multimedia processing; Multimedia tools and applications; Real-time multimedia communications; WebRTC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982108474"

The heterogeneity of the surface was directly modeled as a series of micro-patterned pillars. To resolve the influence of air around a droplet and between the pillars, extensive simulations were performed for different droplet sizes on a textured surface. Parallel computations with the OpenMP algorithm were used to accelerate computation speed to meet the convergence criteria. The composition of the air-solid surface underneath the droplet facilitated capturing the transition from a no-slip/no-penetration to a partial-slip with penetration as the contact line at triple point started moving to the air pockets. The wettability effect from the nanoscopic roughness and the coating was included in the model by using the intrinsic contact angle obtained from a previously published study. As the coalescence started, the radial velocity of the coalescing liquid bridge was partially reverted to the upward direction due to the counter-action of the surface. However, we found that the velocity varied with the size of the droplets. A part of the droplet kinetic energy was dissipated as the merged droplet started penetrating into the cavities. This was due to a different area in contact between the liquid and solid and, consequently, a higher viscous dissipation rate in the system. We showed that the effect of surface roughness is strongly significant when the size of the micro-droplet is comparable with the size of the roughness features. In addition, the relevance of droplet size to surface roughness (critical relative roughness) was numerically quantified. We also found that regardless of the viscous cutoff radius, as the relative roughness approached the value of 44, the direct inclusion of surface topography was crucial in the modeling of the droplet-surface interaction. Finally, we validated our model against existing experimental data in the literature, verifying the effect of relative roughness on the jumping velocity of a merged droplet.","Application programming interfaces (API); Contact angle; Drops; Flocculation; Hydrophobicity; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Micromachining; Surface properties; Convergence criterion; Dynamic contact angle; Extensive simulations; Nanoscopic roughness; Self-propelled jumping; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Viscous dissipation rate; Volume of fluid method; Surface roughness","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010223671"

A two-dimensional lattice with nine velocity components was used in both Lattice-Boltzmann models. A confidence level of 99% was utilized to obtain statistical results of porosity, effective porosity, and tortuosity of the system with 0%, 10%, and 20% liquid formation. Velocity distributions in randomly generated inhomogeneous porous channels with different solid-liquid-vapor combinations were analyzed. The statistical results show that the porosity range of the initially generated porous media lies between the specified error limit of 0.001 determined by the confidence level study for all three cases with 70%, 80%, and 90% target porosity. When target porosity decreases, the difference between porosity and effective porosity increases, and the effective porosity range gets wider than the range of porosity. Effective diffusion coefficient decreases with increase in liquid formation, since the effective porosity decreases.

The CBES Toolkit includes a web app (APP) for end users and the CBES Application Programming Interface (API) for integrating CBES with other energy software tools. The toolkit provides a rich set of features including: (1) Energy Benchmarking providing an Energy Star score, (2) Load Shape Analysis to identify potential building operation improvements, (3) Preliminary Retrofit Analysis which uses a custom developed pre-simulated database and, (4) Detailed Retrofit Analysis which utilizes real-time EnergyPlus simulations. CBES includes 100 configurable energy conservation measures (ECMs) that encompass IAQ, technical performance and cost data, for assessing 7 different prototype buildings in 16 climate zones in California and 6 vintages. A case study of a small office building demonstrates the use of the toolkit for retrofit analysis.

The rigid–flexible multibody system is meshed by using a unified mesh of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF). That is, the flexible parts are meshed by using the finite elements of the ANCF, while the rigid parts are described via the ANCF reference nodes (ANCF-RNs). Firstly, the interval differential-algebraic equations are directly transformed into the nonlinear interval algebraic equations by using the generalized-alpha algorithm. Then, the Chebyshev sampling methods, including Chebyshev tensor product sampling method and Chebyshev collocation method, are used to transform the nonlinear interval algebraic equations into sets of nonlinear algebraic equations with deterministic sampling parameters. The proposed computation methodology is non-intrusive because the original generalized-alpha algorithm is not amended. OpenMP directives are also used to parallelize the solving process of these deterministic nonlinear algebraic equations. To circumvent the interval explosion problem and maintain computation efficiency, the scanning method is used to determine the upper and lower bounds of the deducted Chebyshev surrogate models. Finally, two numerical examples are studied to validate the proposed methodology. The first example is used to check the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

However, to achieve this integration and make them easy to program, we first need to enable users with varying expertise to easily develop cloud applications that leverage FPGAs. With the growing size of FPGAs, allocating them monolithically to users can be wasteful due to potentially low device utilization. Hence, we also need to be able to dynamically share FPGAs among multiple users. To address these concerns, we propose a methodology and a runtime system that together simplify the FPGA application development process by providing: 1) a clean abstraction with high-level APIs for easy application development; 2) a simple execution model that supports both hardware and software execution; and 3) a shared memory-model which is convenient to use for the programmers. Akin to an operating system on a computer, our lightweight runtime system enables the simultaneous execution of multiple applications by virtualizing computational resources, i.e., FPGA resources and on-board memory, and offers protection facilities to isolate applications from each other.

Modified Vlasov foundation model is used to determine the soil parameters as a function of vertical deformation profile within subsoil. The iterative parameter updating procedure involves the use of Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) feature of SAP2000 to provide two way data flow during execution. A computing tool coded in MATLAB employing OAPI is used to perform the analysis of hyperbolic cooling tower with supporting columns over a hollow annular raft founded on elastic subsoil. The analysis of such complex soil-structure system is investigated under self-weight and unsymmetrical wind load. The response of the cooling tower on elastic subsoil is compared with that of a tower that its supporting raft foundation is treated as fixed at the base. The results show that the effect of subsoil on the behavior of cooling tower is considerable at the top and bottom of the wall as well as supporting columns and raft foundation. The application of a full-size cooling tower has demonstrated that the procedure is simple, fast and can easily be implemented in practice.

However, the hardware needed was prohibitively expensive [2]. The present paper shows that a multiscale approach can perform the simulation in a fraction of time without loss of useful information. The main problem is the correct passing of agents from a coarse scale model to a fine scale model, here from a CA model to a force based model. This will be achieved by inserting agents into the force based model at positions and speeds optimized for smooth walking either by a priori information or using Voronoi cells. The resulting model is easily parallelised using OpenMP, achieving reasonable efficiency. We also show how a CA method can be modified to address the problem better than standard CA, too.

The sorted set of points is then divided into M subsets Si, 1≤i≤M of equal size n/M. The multithreaded version of the Delaunay kernel inserts M points at a time in the triangulation. OpenMP barriers provide the required synchronization that is needed after each multiple insertion in order to avoid data races. This simple approach exhibits two standard problems of parallel computing: load imbalance and parallel overheads.

This creates challenges regarding traffic management and requires traffic-aware intelligent network management to deliver sustained quality of experience for subscribers. Deep packet inspection and analysis (DPIA) provides base platform for development of traffic-aware intelligent network management and security systems. However, computationally complex DPIA-related packet processing for high speed data traffic makes these systems expensive. Furthermore, conventionally these traffic-aware network management and security systems are deployed in enterprise networks with independent and dedicated DPIA-related processing resources and require multiple copies of passively provisioned high speed data from network, while performing similar DPIA operations over the same data again and again. This duplicate deployment of expensive software and hardware resources for DPIA processing eventually results in higher capital expenditures as well as operational expenditures for network operators. We have proposed a novel service-oriented framework for heterogeneous deep packet inspection and analysis (SoDPI) that simultaneously provides diversified DPIA services to multiple client applications for network management and security operations in high-speed networks. Proposed framework provides flexible and comprehensive API-based service interface for client applications to register required DPIA services. SoDPI framework implementation is based on commodity hardware and deploys shared set of DPIA-related packet processing components, requiring only single copy of passive data provisioned from network. Experimental evaluations show that novel SoDPI framework requires considerably reduced amount of software and hardware resources to fulfill heterogeneous DPIA packet processing requirements for multiple client applications in comparison with conventional network management and security applications with dedicated DPIA components. This results in lower cost impacts for network operators with more network manageability. © 2016 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Complex networks; Computer supported cooperative work; Cost effectiveness; Hardware; HIgh speed networks; Information management; Inspection; Intelligent networks; Network management; Packet networks; Quality of service; Reconfigurable hardware; Security systems; Cost effective; Deep packet inspection; Network Monitoring; Service Oriented; Traffic aware; Network security","cost effective; Deep packet inspection; network monitoring; service oriented; traffic-aware network management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994417128"

TUSK systems consist of a rigid winged-shaped kite moving in an ocean current. The kite is connected by tethers to a platform on the ocean surface or anchored to the seabed. Hydrodynamic forces generated by the kite are transmitted through the tethers to a generator on the platform to produce electricity. TUSK systems are being considered as an alternative to marine turbines since the kite can move at a high-speed, thereby increasing power production compared to conventional marine turbines. The twodimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved on a regular structured grid to resolve the ocean current flow, and a fictitious domain-immersed boundary method is used for the rigid kite. A projection method along with open multiprocessing (OpenMP) is employed to solve the flow equations. The reel-out and reel-in velocities of the two tethers are adjusted to control the kite angle of attack and the resultant hydrodynamic forces. A baseline simulation, where a high net power output was achieved during successive kite power and retraction phases, is examined in detail. The effects of different key design parameters in TUSK systems, such as the ratio of tether to current velocity, kite weight, current velocity, and the tether to kite chord length ratio, are then further studied. System power output, vorticity flow fields, tether tensions, and hydrodynamic coefficients for the kite are determined. The power output results are shown to be in good agreement with the established theoretical results for a kite moving in two dimensions. © 2016 by ASME.","Angle of attack; Application programming interfaces (API); Computational fluid dynamics; Electric power generation; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Ocean currents; Sailing vessels; Tetherlines; Thermoelectric power; Turbines; Turbulent flow; Hydrodynamic coefficients; Hydrodynamic forces; Immersed boundary methods; Key design parameters; Nonlinear computational model; Ocean current flows; Open multiprocessings; Two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations; Navier Stokes equations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987650874"

We propose a formal model called E-commerce Business Process Net to model a normal online shopping business process that represent intended functions, and malicious behavior patterns representing a potential attack that violates the security goals at the requirement analysis phase. Then, we synthesize the normal business process and malicious behavior patterns by an incremental modeling method. According to the synthetic model, we analyze whether an online shopping business process is resistant to the known malicious behavior patterns. As a result, our approach can make the software design provably secured from the malicious attacks at process design time and, thus, reduces the difficulty and cost of modification for imperfect systems at the release phase.

This study adopted a web-based IMS user and deployed a gateway between IMS users and an IMS network. Users can access IMS services by employing any device equipped with a web browser which supports a web real-time communication application programming interface.

This paper uses the multi-core technology to achieve the parallelism of wavelet and wavelet packet transforms, so that the computation speed is increasing and the time is shortening in the practical applications. The parallel algorithms of wavelet and wavelet packet transforms, respectively, on the basis of POSIX thread and OpenMP are proposed and realized. The parallel results can meet the requirements by comparing parallel algorithms with the serial algorithms of single-layer and multi-layer transforms. For OpenMP, the paper takes the guidance statements to parallelize the loops of serial programs. In addition, the paper proposes one kind of nesting and non-nesting parallel means of wavelet packet transform and compares the parallel results with the serial programs. The experimental results show that the speedup is increasing with the amount of data and finally closing to 2. It is shown that the proposed parallel algorithms can improve the transform speed significantly. These parallel algorithms are applied in the harmonic analysis and data compression of power system, and a parallel strategy for compression with bitmap is proposed. The results show that the parallel algorithms of wavelet and wavelet packet transforms can improve the analysis and compression speed significantly. © Copyright 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Grinding (machining); Harmonic analysis; Packet networks; Parallel algorithms; Telecommunication traffic; Wavelet transforms; Compression speed; Multi-core parallels; Network structures; Parallel strategies; power system; Power system harmonics; Serial algorithms; Wavelet packet transforms; Data compression","multi-core parallel; power data compression; power system; wavelet packet transform; wavelet transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954461313"

To solve these problems, we improve the progress of packet processing technologies such as New Application Programming Interface (NAPI) and zero copy and propose an efficient quasi-real-time intrusion detection system. Our work detects botnet using supervised machine learning approach under the high-speed network environment. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Build a detection framework using PF-RING for sniffing and processing network traces to extract flow features dynamically. (2) Use random forest model to extract promising conversation features. (3) Analyze the performance of different classification algorithms.

The most recent API-based software birthmarking method (Han et al., 2014) extracts API call sequences in entire code sections of a program. Additionally, it is generated as a birthmark using a cryptographic hash function (MD5). It was reported that different application types can be categorized in a program through pre-filtering based on DLL/API numbers/names. However, similarity cannot be measured owing to the cryptographic hash function, occurrence of false negatives, and it is difficult to functionally categorize applications using only DLL/API numbers/names. In this paper, we propose an API-based software birthmarking method using fuzzy hashing. For the native code of a program, our software birthmarking technique extracts API call sequences in the segmented procedures and then generates them using a fuzzy hash function. Unlike the conventional cryptographic hash function, the fuzzy hash is used for the similarity measurement of data. Our method using a fuzzy hash function achieved a high reduction ratio (about 41% on average) more than an original birthmark that is generated with only the API call sequences. In our experiments, when threshold "" is 0:35, the results show that our method is an effective birthmarking system to measure similarities of the software. Moreover, our correlation analysis with top 50 API call frequencies proves that it is difficult to functionally categorize applications using only DLL/API numbers/names. Compared to prior work, our method significantly improves the properties of resilience and credibility. © 2016 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Copyrights; Cryptography; Delay lock loops; Hash functions; API-based sequences; Birthmarking; Fuzzy hash; Software birthmarks; Software similarities; Application programs","API-based sequences; Birthmarking systems; Fuzzy hash; Software birthmark; Software similarity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976875131"

Then, four sub-filters are designed according to the received observations and the achieved target shape parameters. The output of the proposed tracking filer can be obtained by the weighted-confidence fusion of the sub-filters. Finally, the machine vision algorithm is evaluated by the virtual target images created in OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and the real images of a moving ship.

By taking a 3-DOF spindle head named A3 head as an example, this paper presents a feature-based CAD–CAE integration methodology for the static and dynamic analyses of PKMs. The approach can be implemented by four steps: (1) creation of a parameterized geometric (CAD) model with analysis features in SolidWorks; (2) extraction of the features from the CAD model using the Application Programming Interface (API) available in SolidWorks; (3) formulation of a CAD model in SAMCEF by mapping the configuration features from SolidWorks to SAMCEF; and (4) conversion of the analysis features into a scripting language named Bacon for Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The merit of this approach lies in that the FE model at different configurations can be updated automatically in batch mode, and PKMs having different topologies can be modeled with ease thanks to the down to link/joint level featuring.

Limited information can be found in literature about the girth welding of these materials. This investigation presents the hardness, toughness, tensile, and sour resistance results of welded joints produced on API 5L X70 and X80 pipes developed for sour service. The joints were welded with the gas metal arc welding process for the root pass and flux cored arc welding process for the fill passes. The test methodology included tensile, bending, and nick-break tests as required by the API 1104 standard. The joints were also submitted to Charpy, crack opening displacement (CTOD), hardness, and stress corrosion tests. All joints met the requirements defined by API 1104 for tensile, bending, and nick-break tests. The Charpy tests presented high values of absorbed energy. The weld metal and HAZ of X70 and X80 presented good toughness according to the CTOD results, although one specimen for X80 exhibited low CTOD. All joints met the requirements of the stress corrosion cracking test. Considering all results, the weldability study demonstrated that both X70 and X80 sour service pipes were appropriate for sour service applications. For X80, it is recommended to perform an in-depth analysis of the heat-affected-zone (HAZ) toughness before the use of this material.

The OpenMP programming technology combined with an existing MPI program contained in the parallel version of SPHysics code has been implemented to enable the simulation of hundred millions of particles running on a computer cluster. As part of the numerical basin development work an active absorbing wave maker and a sponge layer are introduced. The dynamic boundary conditions are also corrected to reduce the spurious effects. Wave generation and propagation in the numerical wave basin is first tested and confirmed with analytical results.

These applications and technologies have inadequate interoperability and there is still a dearth of investigations addressing interoperability issues in the structural engineering domain. This paper proposes a novel approach which combines an industry foundation classes (IFC)-based Unified Information Model with a number of algorithms to enhance the interoperability: (a) between architectural and structural models, and (b) among multiple structural analysis models (bidirectional conversion or round tripping). The proposed approach aims to achieve the conversion by overcoming the inconsistencies in data structures, representation logics and syntax used in different software applications. The approach was implemented in both Client Server (C/S) and Browser Server (B/S) environments to enable central and remote collaboration among geographically dispersed users. The platforms were tested in four large real-life projects. The testing involved four key scenarios: (a) the bidirectional conversion among four structural analysis tools; (b) the comparison of the conversion via the proposed approach with the conversion via direct links among the involved tools; (c) the direct export from an IFC-based architectural tool through the Application Program Interface (API), and (d) the conversion and visualization of structural analysis results. All these scenarios were successfully performed and tested in four significant case studies. In particular, the conversion among the four structural analysis applications (ETABS, SAP2000, ANSYS and MIDAS) was successfully tested for all possible conversion routes among the four applications in two of the case studies (i.e., Project A and Project B). The first four steps of natural mode shapes and their natural vibration periods were calculated and compared with the converted models. They were all achieved within a standard deviation of 0.1 s and 0.2 s in Project A and Project B, respectively, indicating an accurate conversion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although dense eigenvalue calculations for subproblems in RR steps can be parallelized to a certain level, their parallel scalability, which is limited by some inherent sequential steps, is lower than dense matrix-matrix multiplications. The primary motivation of this paper is to develop a methodology that reduces the use of the RR procedure in exchange for matrix-matrix multiplications. We propose an unconstrained trace-penalty minimization model and establish its equivalence to the eigenvalue problem. With a suitably chosen penalty parameter, this model possesses far fewer undesirable full-rank stationary points than the classic trace minimization model. More importantly, it enables us to deploy algorithms that makes heavy use of dense matrix-matrix multiplications. Although the proposed algorithm does not necessarily reduce the total number of arithmetic operations, it leverages highly optimized operations on modern high performance computers to achieve parallel scalability. Numerical results based on a preliminary implementation, parallelized using OpenMP, show that our approach is promising. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Gradient methods; Microprocessor chips; Scalability; Arithmetic operations; Eigenvalue calculations; Eigenvalue computation; Exact quadratic penalty approach; Matrix matrix multiplications; Modern high performance; Optimized operations; Penalty minimization; Matrix algebra","Eigenvalue computation; Exact quadratic penalty approach; Gradient methods","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957441449"

Although the communication distance is subject to a limitation attributable to the QKD fundamentals, recent research and development of ""key relaying"" over a ""QKD network"" is overcoming this limitation. However, there are still barriers to widespread use of QKD integrated with conventional information systems: applicability and development cost. In order to break down these barriers, this paper proposes a new solution for developing secure network infrastructure based on QKD technology to accommodate multiple applications. The proposed solution introduces 3 functions: (1) a directory mechanism to manage multiple applications hosted on the QKD network, (2) a key management method to share and to allocate the keys for multiple applications, and (3) a cryptography communication library enabling existing cryptographic communication software to be ported to the QKD network easily. The proposed solution allows the QKD network to accommodate multiple applications of various types, and moreover, realizes applicability to conventional information systems easily. It also contributes to a reduction in the development cost per information system, since the development cost of the QKD network can be shared between the multiple applications. The proposed solution was implemented with a network emulating QKD technology and evaluated. The evaluation results show that the proposed solution enables the infrastructure of a single QKD network to host multiple applications concurrently, fairly, and effectively through a conventional application programming interface, OpenSSL API. In addition, the overhead of secure session establishment by the proposed solution was quantitatively evaluated and compared. © Copyright 2016 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer systems programming; Costs; Cryptography; Information systems; Information theory; Quantum cryptography; Secure communication; Communication distance; Communication library; Communication software; Information- theoretic securities; Key management; Multiple applications; Network infrastructure; Quantum key; Network security","Key management; Network infrastructure; Quantum Key Distributio; Secure communication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969922343"

Even in the embedded domain, the development of platforms based on multiprocessor systems or the porting of legacy single-core applications are frequent needs. However, such designs are often complicated, as embedded systems are characterized by numerous non-functional requirements and a tight hardware/software integration. This work proposes a methodology for the development and validation of an embedded multiprocessor system. Specifically, the proposed method assumes the use of a portable, open source API to support the parallelization and the possibility of prototyping the system on a field-programmable gate array. On this basis, the proposed flow allows an early exploration of the hardware configuration space, a preliminary estimate of performance, and the rapid development of a system able to satisfy the design specifications. An accurate assessment of the actual performance of the system is then enforced by the use of an hardware-based profiling subsystem. The proposed design flow is described, and a version specifically designed for LEON3 processor is presented and validated. The application of the proposed methodology in a real case of industrial study is then presented and analyzed. © 2016, The Author(s).","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer hardware; Computer operating systems; Embedded systems; Fault tolerance; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Legacy systems; Linux; Multiprocessing systems; Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Software architecture; Embedded multiprocessors; Hardware/software integration; Multi processor systems; Multicore architectures; Non-functional requirements; Parallelizations; Performance evaluation; Reconfigurable logic; Open systems","Embedded systems; Multicore architectures; Parallelization framework; Performance evaluation; Reconfigurable logics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987863702"

The subsequent acceleration of the methods is also evaluated. The simulation results show that the OpenMP and MPI parallel methods achieve a speedup factor of 9.8× and 5.1×, respectively, on a 32-core computer, whereas the OpenACC parallel method achieves a speedup factor of 20.7× on NVIDIA Tesla K20c graphics card.

This paper proposes an automatic approach for solving the SPRD problem based on the grid theory and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The fitness functions which are used in the PSO algorithm are formulated to evaluate the engineering objectives and constraints. A fixed-length particle encoding is improved according to the characteristics of ship pipe routing in 3-D space to overcome the shortcomings of variable-length encoding. Mutation operation is combined with the computing process of PSO to avoid the problem of local optimum and to accelerate the convergence rate. Based on the proposed algorithm, the multi-swarms optimization with co-evolution mechanism is applied to solve the problem of multiple pipes and branch pipe routing. The simulations of pipe routing examples are conducted by using VC++ and OpenGL, which demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Results show that our approach can route the most common variations of ship pipes automatically under certain constraints in 3-D space.

However, it is not the mere existence of data that is important, but our ability to make use of it. Experience has shown that when metadata is better organized and more complete, the underlying data becomes more useful. Traditionally, capturing the steps of scientific workflows and metadata was the role of the lab notebook, but the digital era has resulted instead in the fragmentation of data, processing, and annotation. This paper presents the Metadata, Provenance, and Ontology (MPO) System, the software that can automate the documentation of scientific workflows and associated information. Based on recorded metadata, it provides explicit information about the relationships among the elements of workflows in notebook form augmented with directed acyclic graphs. A set of web-based graphical navigation tools and Application Programming Interface (API) have been created for searching and browsing, as well as programmatically accessing the workflows and data. We describe the MPO concepts and its software architecture.

Although many different techniques are involved in solving Poisson's equation, we focused on the Monte Carlo method (MCM). We preferred the MCM not only because of its simple algorithm but also for its excellent parallel efficiency. Parallelization is one of the most effective techniques for reducing computation time. Among many parallelization paradigms, such as OpenMP (open multiprocessing), MPI (message passing interface), and PGAS (partitioned global address space), we adopted the PGAS-based Coarray Fortran (CAF). In this paper, we demonstrated that parallelization of Poisson's equation solver with CAF was quite painless. After parallelization, we solved Poisson's equation for a nonrectangular domain. We started with a workstation that consisted of 8 cores and we continued with a Cray supercomputer of up to 512 cores. The results of the parallel solvers were validated using exact solutions. We demonstrated that the error was less than 1.6%. Additionally, solution times and speedups of the CAF-based solver were compared with a solver that utilized MPI or OpenMP. OpenMP was not able to compete against CAF and MPI because of the ""while"" loop restriction. The CAF-based solver performed slightly better (7.5%) than the MPI provided that core numbers were between 2 and 32. However, CAF and MPI performed similarly for higher numbers of cores. © 2016 TÜBİTAK.","Application programming interfaces (API); Electric fields; FORTRAN (programming language); Heat transfer; Message passing; Monte Carlo methods; Room and pillar mining; Supercomputers; Co-array Fortran; Cray supercomputers; Electric field calculations; Message passing interface; Open multiprocessings; OpenMP; Parallel efficiency; Partitioned Global Address Space; Poisson equation","Coarray Fortran; Message passing interface; Monte Carlo methods; OpenMP; Poisson's equation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978287489"

However, using such wealth of material, typically dispersed in several repositories, in a simple and effective way, is rather challenging due to the difficulties encountered by teachers in learning the peculiar access and operational procedures that each repository system requires. Therefore, it is important to provide the teachers with a centralized, integrated, simple system that can address most of their needs so that every operation (search, edit, share, download) can be done from a single location. This work follows this direction by designing and presenting both an architecture to integrate different repository systems using the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) API and an integration layer that provides a simple web interface suitable for the needs of both the content creators (teachers) and the users of the contents (learners). Results have been evaluated both quantitatively, i.e., using performance indicators such as response time, and qualitatively, on the basis of the user experience evaluated through a questionnaire. Both type of results show that the platform adequately addresses user needs therefore it has the potential to be embraced by a large user community.","Application programming interfaces (API); Interoperability; Learning systems; CMIS; Computer uses in education; Content management; E-learning tool; Educational resource; Open sources; Operational procedures; Performance indicators; User experience","CMIS; Computer uses in education; E-learning tools; Open source","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014350703"

First, we describe performance optimization methods for mobile graphics applications in 2 dimensions: Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) performance and image quality. Second, we present an adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) configuration method for graphics applications via OpenGL ES API level.

Overall, the experimental result shows that the proposed technique allows 24 % of performance improvement for all applied methodologies, and 4 % improvement for some selected methodologies while causing around 14 and 2 % of quality degradation, respectively.

It is more common to find active or transitive verbs and adverbs in tweets from personal accounts because individuals report personal experiences (e.g., “just saw an accident”). Tweets from an organization or agency [e.g., 511 (a telephone hotline for transportation information widely used in the United States and Canada), departments of transportation] are more structured and commonly include nouns and past participles (e.g., “one lane blocked”). Organization accounts mostly provide incident location, type, severity, and so on, whereas personal tweets do not usually provide such details. However, an agency tweets about an incident usually after the incident management (IM) officials have already been notified. Because of this timing, a personal tweet is more likely to carry useful “new” information for IM purposes. This study investigated the detection of traffic incidents through Twitter feeds by using these differences in structure and information content found in organization and personal social media accounts. Tweets collected via the Twitter public application programming interface were manually coded and treated separately as either personal or organizational, and the “dictionaries” used to perform relevancy classification were derived separately. Combinations of dictionaries (i.e., personal only, organizational only, personal and organizational) were used for “term frequency–inverse document frequency” and naïve Bayesian analysis. It was shown that analysis specific to account types helped achieve better accuracy in classification for targeting relevant tweets. Therefore, account-specific analysis should be considered for more efficient and effective event detection for IM purposes. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

The approach used is a physically intuitive methodology whose formulation is based on the theoretical foundations of the mechanics of continuous media. This version of the Path Tubes method draws on a semi-Lagrangian time discretization that employs the Reynolds's transport theorem and a localization strategy. This time discretization can be seen as a transformation that acts on the Navier-Stokes equations, transforming this classical nonlinear model into linear partial differential equations of the (essentially) parabolic type. The result is an implicit semi-Lagrangian algorithm that allows the use of classical schemes for spatial discretization such as central-difference formulas, without the need to use upwind techniques or high-order corrections for time derivatives. The Path Tubes method was implemented through parallel computing. For this, we use a computer equipped with shared-memory multiprocessors and the OpenMP software. After intensive numerical tests and using different values of Reynolds numbers typical of advection-dominated flows, the proposed method proved to be accurate and able to work with coarse grids. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Advection; Application programming interfaces (API); Computation theory; Lagrange multipliers; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Multiprocessing systems; Newtonian liquids; Non Newtonian flow; Nonlinear equations; Numerical methods; Reynolds number; Tubes (components); Viscous flow; Implicit schemes; Incompressible Newtonian fluid; Interpolation formulas; Linear partial differential equations; Path Tubes method; Semi-Lagrangian; Shared memory multiprocessor; Time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations; Navier Stokes equations","Advection-dominated flow; Implicit scheme; Interpolation formula; Navier-Stokes equation; Path Tubes method; Semi-Lagrangian algorithm","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85024372578"

This requires OEMs to equip their diesel engines with costly after-treatment, EGR systems and higher rail pressure fuel systems. By one estimate, BS-VI engines are expected to be 15 to 20% more expensive than BS-IV engines, while also suffering with 2 to 3 % lower fuel economy. OEMs are looking for solutions to meet the BS-VI emissions standards while still keeping the upfront and operating costs low enough for their products to attract customers; however traditional engine technologies seem to have exhausted the possibilities. Fuel economy improvement technologies applied to traditional 4-stroke engines bring small benefits with large cost penalties. One promising solution to meet both current, and future, emissions standards with much improved fuel economy at lower cost is the Opposed Piston (OP) engine. Recently, there has been surge in developing highly efficient OP engine architecture to modernize it using today’s analytical tools, high pressure fuel system and manufacturing technologies to meet emissions, while reaping the fuel economy advantage. As the company pioneering the OP engine technology, Achates Power Inc. (API) has been publishing technical papers in recent years, including a paper describing inherent efficiency benefits of OP engines, multi-cylinder steady state and transient results for medium duty truck and light duty applications.

It was found that flow behaviour is strongly affected by the surface morphology of the channel. The results indicated that hierarchical structures on the surface could improve the hydrophobicity significantly. For rectangular structures, they can improve the hydrophobicity with the increase of height and distance ratio h/d of the structures, and the improvement will reach its optimal hydrophobicity when the value h/d is over a certain value of 0.6.

For many, the use of wheelchairs is paramount to provide mobility and social inclusion. Nevertheless, they still face a number of challenges to properly function in our society. Among the many difficulties, one in particular stands out: navigating in complex internal environments (indoors). The main objective of this work is to propose an architecture based on Mobile Augmented Reality to support the development of indoor navigation systems dedicated to wheelchair users, that is also capable of recording CAD drawings of the buildings and dealing with accessibility issues for that population. Methods: Overall, five main functional requirements are proposed: the ability to allow for indoor navigation by means of Mobile Augmented Reality techniques; the capacity to register and configure building CAD drawings and the position of fiducial markers, points of interest and obstacles to be avoided by the wheelchair user; the capacity to find the best route for wheelchair indoor navigation, taking stairs and other obstacles into account; allow for the visualization of virtual directional arrows in the smartphone displays; and incorporate touch or voice commands to interact with the application. The architecture is proposed as a combination of four layers: User interface; Control; Service; and Infrastructure. A proof-of-concept application was developed and tests were performed with disable volunteers operating manual and electric wheelchairs. Results: The application was implemented in Java for the Android operational system. A local database was used to store the test building CAD drawings and the position of fiducial markers and points of interest. The Android Augmented Reality library was used to implement Augmented Reality and the Blender open source library handled the basis for implementing directional navigation arrows. OpenGL ES provided support for various graphics and mathematical transformations for embedded systems, such as smartphones. Experiments were performed in an academic building with various labs, classrooms and male and female bathrooms. Two disable volunteers using wheelchairs showed no difficulties to interact with the application, either by entering touch or voice commands, and to navigate within the testing environment with the help of the navigational arrows implemented by the augmented reality modules. Conclusion: The novel features implemented in the proposed architecture, with special emphasis on the use of Mobile Augmented Reality and the ability to identify the best routes free of potential hazards for wheelchair users, were capable of providing significant benefits for wheelchair indoor navigation when compared to current techniques described in the literature. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

However, the time complexity of the algorithm is very high due to its nonlocality when searching for similar pixels. As a result, the NLM algorithm cannot satisfy the near real-time requirements of some specific applications. To resolve this issue, a parallel NLM algorithm based on Intel Xeon Phi hardware with Intel's many integrated cores (MIC) architecture was designed and implemented in this paper. The parallel algorithm achieved satisfactory speedup, but the speedup obtained showed a step-like distribution for different image sizes. This result was not expected based on the theoretical analysis, which predicted that the speedup should be independent of input data set size. To address this problem, the parallel algorithm was further optimized by adding pretreatment approaches and cutting down the number of nested loops in the MIC. Finally, experiments using the standard and optimized versions were carried out using the RS images of different sizes. Several conclusions could be drawn from the experimental results: 1) the standard parallel algorithm can obtain better speedup with only one MIC card and 2) the optimized parallel algorithm can completely eliminate the step distribution of the speedup and can also accelerate RS image processing significantly. © 2017 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computational complexity; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Microwave integrated circuits; Parallel algorithms; Parallel processing systems; Remote sensing; Image denoising algorithm; Integrated core; Non local means (NLM); Non-local means; OpenMP; Remote sensing image denoising; Remote sensing images; Time complexity; Image denoising","image processing; MIC; OpenMP; Parallel computing; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028853107"

Initially the authors aimed to speed up such simulations by utilizing modern multicore processors in the code implementation. The 30-year-old linear solver was replaced in steps by seven different modern multicore capable solvers. Subsequently, speedup tests were carried out with small- (up to 1.6 × 103 nodes), medium- (up to 6.3 × 104 nodes) and large-sized (up to 6.3 × 105 nodes) test cases. None of the tested solvers was found to perform faster than the original solver for networks with a real-world character, although two solvers showed a speedup on medium and large water distribution networks. This is an example that strategies to reduce computation time can produce promising results in a theoretic research environment, but fail in practical engineering applications. Likewise, this paper highlights again the importance of considering realistic test cases during the implementation phase. Further, the authors point out why the different tested strategies in this work have not succeeded. Although two other issues (implemented hash table and node reordering) could be identified for potential improvement of the code, it was concluded that the original solver is still the fastest for practical system configurations. © ASCE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Parallel processing systems; Compute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA); EPANET 2; Many core; Multi core; OpenMP; Sparse solvers; Water distribution model; computer simulation; distribution system; parallel computing; software; water management; water supply; Water distribution systems","Compute unified device architecture (CUDA); EPANET 2; Many-core; Multicore; OpenMP; Parallel computing; Sparse solver; Water distribution modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958522324"

Current methods, which focus on the secure mechanism, use qualitative analysis to estimate the security of controllers, leading to inaccurate results frequently. In this paper, we employ a quantitative approach to overcome the above shortage. Under the analysis of the controller threat model we give the formal model results of the APIs, the protocol interfaces, and the data items of controller and further provide our Threat/Effort quantitative calculation model. With the help of Threat/Effort model, we are able to compare not only the security of different versions of the same kind controller but also different kinds of controllers and provide a basis for controller selection and secure development. We evaluated our approach in four widely used SDN-based controllers which are POX, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, and Ryu. The test, which shows the similarity outcomes with the traditional qualitative analysis, demonstrates that with our approach we are able to get the specific security values of different controllers and presents more accurate results. © 2017 Zehui Wu and Qiang Wei.","Application programming interfaces (API); Controllers; Electric lighting; Software defined networking; Configuration and managements; Controller selection; Protocol interfaces; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative approach; Quantitative calculation; Security value; Threat modeling; Network security","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015780363"

The potential fracture domains of the flexible body system are described by using the particles of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and the other domains of the system are modeled by using the finite elements of absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF). In order to preserve the continuity of deformation field, extra virtual particles are uniformly embedded into the interface, where the finite elements of ANCF and the particles of SPH are connected, so as to transmit the interaction forces. The OpenACC derivatives are used to parallelize both the particle contact detection and the solution of the integral equations. A predictor-corrector scheme is used to solve the ordinary differential equations for the particles of SPH, while the generalized-alpha method is used to solve the huge set of differential algebraic equations for the multibody system. The OpenMP derivatives are also used to parallelize the evaluation of the elastic force vectors and their Jacobi matrices of the finite elements.

Most Android malware is generated by piggybacking malicious payloads into benign applications (apps), which are called piggybacked apps. In this paper, we propose DAPASA, an approach to detect Android piggybacked apps through sensitive subgraph analysis. Two assumptions are established to reflect the different invocation patterns of sensitive APIs in the injected malicious payloads (rider) of a piggybacked app and in its host app (carrier). With these two assumptions, DAPASA generates a sensitive subgraph (SSG) to profile the most suspicious behavior of an app. Five features are constructed from SSG to depict the invocation patterns. The five features are fed into the machine learning algorithms to detect whether the app is piggybacked or benign. DAPASA is evaluated on a large real-world data set consisting of 2551 piggybacked apps and 44 921 popular benign apps. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits an impressive detection performance compared with that of three baseline approaches even with only five numeric features. Furthermore, the proposed approach can complement permission-based approaches and API-based approaches with the combination of our five features from a new perspective of the invocation structure. © 2017 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Smartphones; Static analysis; Virtual reality; Android malware; Detection performance; Evaluation results; Exponential growth; Malware detection; Popular platform; sensitive API; Subgraphs; Android (operating system)","malware detection; Piggybacked apps; sensitive API; sensitive subgraph; static analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019191558"

A large number of personal e-health measuring and monitoring devices are now in the market. However, to achieve better health outcome, various devices or services need to work together. This coordination among services remains challenge, due to their variations and complexities. To address this issue, we have proposed an ontology-based framework for interactive self-assessment of RESTful e-health services. Unlike existing e-health service frameworks where they had tightly coupling between services, as well as their data schemas were difficult to change and extend in the future. In our work, the loosely coupling among services and flexibility of each service are achieved through the design and implementation based on HYDRA vocabulary and REST principles. We have implemented clinical knowledge through the combination of OWL-DL and SPARQL rules. All of these services evolve independently; their interfaces are based on REST principles, especially HATEOAS constraints. We have demonstrated how to apply our framework for interactive self-assessment in e-health applications. We have shown that it allows the medical knowledge to drive the system workflow according to the event-driven principles. New data schema can be maintained during run-time. This is the essential feature to support arriving of IoT (Internet of Things) based medical devices, which have their own data schema and evolve overtime.

In some cases, pattern recognition algorithms for processing depth images can be tested using actual sensors observing real-world objects. In many situations, however, it is common to test new algorithms using computer-generated synthetic images, as such simulations tend to be faster, more flexible, and less expensive than hardware tests. Computer generation of images is especially useful for Monte Carlo-type analyses or for situations where obtaining real sensor data for preliminary testing is difficult (e.g., space applications). We present GLIDAR, an OpenGL and GL Shading Language-based sensor simulator, capable of imaging nearly any static three-dimensional model. GLIDAR allows basic object manipulations, or may be connected to a physics simulator for more advanced behaviors.

In order to meet the demands of such applications, it is important to have adaptive and self-reconfiguring hardware platforms, coupled with intelligent on-line optimization algorithms, that together can adjust to the run-time requirements. Partially dynamically reconfigurable field programmable gate array architectures offer both high performance and flexibility. Despite these potential advantages, the challenges faced by designers trying to set-up a functioning system are still significant, mainly because of the still immature design tools and limited device drivers. We propose a complete framework, based on Xilinx's commercial design suite, that enables an application designer to leverage the advantages of partial dynamic reconfiguration with minimal effort. Our IP-based architecture, together with the comprehensive application programming interface, can be employed to accelerate an application by dynamically scheduling hardware prefetches. Moreover, a piecewise linear predictor is used to capture correlations and predict the hardware modules that will generate the highest performance improvement. Our evaluation comprises of extensive simulations, as well as a complete implementation of the smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus image processing application on the ML605 board from Xilinx.

These features are especially useful in situations where many transducers are deployed, since their setup becomes a cumbersome task that consumes a significant amount of time and human resources. HASITE simplifies the deployment of a home automation system by using wireless networks and both self-configuration and self-registration protocols. Thanks to the application of these three elements, HASITE is able to add new transducers by just powering them up. According to the tests performed in different realistic scenarios, a transducer is ready to be used in less than 13 s. Moreover, all HASITE functionalities can be accessed through an API, which also allows for the integration of third-party systems. As an example, an Android application based on the API is presented. Remote users can use it to interact with transducers by just using a regular smartphone or a tablet. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Application programming interfaces (API); Transducers; Wireless sensor networks; Android applications; Home automation; Home automation systems; ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451; Plug and play; Realistic scenario; Self configuration; Third party systems; Automation","Home automation; IoT; ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451; Plug-and-play; Self-configuration; Transducer; Wireless sensor networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989282513"

Other governments, including Australia, with a national map of 2D map information have not yet provided GIS-based open data and open application programming interfaces (APIs). On the other hand, the Korean government has actively opened up GIS-based information called VWorld and open APIs. However, the building industry has not yet exploited this information, and it seems to lack accessibility. Therefore, authors aim to support fast and expanding open data and propose a middleware that uses VWorld as a target platform for searching, processing, and generating GIS-based open data toward realizing building information modelling (BIM) exchangeable information. A Web 2.0 based middleware should be different from a Web 1.0 counterpart so that open data from suppliers are guided and delivered to data consumers in customized data formats. Authors expect that this study will serve as a general guiding approach for harvesting GIS-based open data as soon as other governments provide open data in the near future.

In this SPH method, a dummy particle wall-boundary condition is automatically implemented to meet the requirement of application on geometrically complex engineering problems. An efficient particle search strategy merging the ideal of Cell-linked list with Vertlet list is proposed to speed up the neighbor particles search process. The present SPH method uses an OpenMP memory-shared parallelization in conjunction with Z-curve reordering to accelerate the computation. Validations have been performed on several classic hydrodynamic problems, where good agreements were achieved via comparing with documented experimental results.

Since the emergence of GIS technology, there has been an increase of spatial data usage throughout the world. Nowadays, a majority of data transfer is accomplished through the internet. Spatial data can be accessed through standardized web services which sometimes offer large quantities of spatial data. Present study has been carried out to understand some of the problems in fluoride affected areas of Nalgonda district through advanced geospatial techniques. Fluoride concentration data of study area is collected from the different government agencies. Geo-statistical approach has been used to prepare the fluoride concentration map of the study area. Based on the distribution of fluoride concentration, the fluoride affected areas are zoned into high, medium and low categories. Fluoride concentration map is then superimposed with the habitation map.

However, the simulation results crucially depend on the quality of the potential being used. Force matching is a method aimed at constructing reliable and transferable interatomic potentials by matching the forces computed by the potential as closely as possible, with those obtained from first principles calculations. The potfit program is an implementation of the force-matching method that optimizes the potential parameters using a global minimization algorithm followed by a local minimization polish. We extended potfit in two ways. First, we adapted the code to be compliant with the KIM Application Programming Interface (API) standard (part of the Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models project). This makes it possible to use potfit to fit many KIM potential models, not just those prebuilt into the potfit code. Second, we incorporated the geodesic Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) minimization algorithm into potfit as a new local minimization algorithm. The extended potfit was tested by generating a training set using the KIM environment-dependent interatomic potential (EDIP) model for silicon and using potfit to recover the potential parameters from different initial guesses. The results show that EDIP is a 'sloppy model' in the sense that its predictions are insensitive to some of its parameters, which makes fitting more difficult. We find that the geodesic LM algorithm is particularly efficient for this case. The extended potfit code is the first step in developing a KIM-based fitting framework for interatomic potentials for bulk and two-dimensional materials.

This is particularly critical for video streaming in multimedia delivery on moving handheld mobile consumer devices. A powerful forward error-correction mechanism is the fountain coding scheme implemented by RaptorQ codes, defined over GF(256), whose decoding algorithms are very complex from a computational perspective, but highly suitable for parallelization. With multimedia delivery for handheld consumer electronics in mind, this paper proposes several decoding schemes for embedded mobile SoCs, exploiting both the parallel potential of the GPU and CPU, sharing a common memory space. The OpenCL and OpenMP frameworks are used to exploit both accelerators for the roles of matrix multiplication and inversion that comprise the bulk of computation in RaptorQ decoding. Reported results indicate low-power requirements within the range of typical handheld consumer devices (1.5∼2.4W) for data processing rates of dozens of Mbit/s that are fully within the real-time requirements of HD, 2K and 4K coded video streaming resolutions and beyond. © 2016 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Complex networks; Data handling; Decoding; Digital television; Energy conservation; Error correction; Forward error correction; Packet networks; Video signal processing; Embedded processors; High definition video; Low Power; Parallel processing; RaptorQ codes; Video streaming","Energy saving; Forward error correction; High-definition video streaming; Low-power; Mobile embedded processors; Parallel processing; RaptorQ codes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011976656"

The method adopts preconditioning and waveform prediction to accelerate convergence of the system. Moreover, a two-stage parallel strategy based on OpenMP further improves parallel efficiency. All subsystems are solved using a very dishonest Newton (VDHN) method combined with an iteration method based on Adomian decomposition independently after the state variables are discretized by implicit-trapezoidal rule.

However, technologies from different providers lack both technical and semantic interoperability and hence the resulting health data are often deeply tied to a specific service, which is limiting its reusability and utilization in different services. We have designed a Wellness Warehouse Engine (W2E) that bridges this gap and enables seamless exchange of data between different services. W2E provides interfaces to various data sources and makes data available via unified representational state transfer application programming interface to other services. Importantly, it includes Unifier-an engine that allows transforming input data into generic units reusable by other services, and Analyzer-an engine that allows advanced analysis of input data, such as combining different data sources into new output parameters. In this paper, we describe the architecture of W2E and demonstrate its applicability by using it for unifying data from four consumer activity trackers, using a test base of 20 subjects each carrying out three different tracking sessions.

Therefore, high-performance calculations are of great importance to the simulation of dam-break events. In this study, we develop a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model based on the finite volume method to simulate the dam-break flow routing process. Roe's approximate Riemann solution is adopted to solve the interface flux of grid cells and accurately simulate the discontinuous flow. A graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel method, OpenACC, is used to realize parallel computing. Because an explicit discrete technique is used to solve the governing equations, and there is no correlation between grid calculations in a single time step, the parallel dam-break model can be easily realized by adding OpenACC directives to the loop structure of the grid calculations. To analyze the performance of the model, we considered the Pangtoupao flood storage area in China using a Nvidia Tesla K20c card and four different grid division schemes. By carefully studying the implementation method and optimization of data transportation in the parallel algorithm, a speedup factor of 20.70 can be achieved. This acceleration is better than that of the OpenMP method with a 16-kernel computer. Further analysis reveals that models involving a larger number of calculations exhibit greater efficiency and a higher speedup rate. In addition, the OpenACC parallel mode has good portability, making it easy to realize parallel computation from the original serial model. This GPU-based parallel computation has the advantages of high performance and easily available required hardware. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Dams; Digital storage; Finite volume method; Program processors; Dam-break flow; Discontinuous flow; Governing equations; Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); High-performance calculations; Openacc; Parallel Computation; Two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling; dam failure; finite volume method; flow modeling; hydrodynamics; numerical model; parallel computing; two-dimensional modeling; Graphics processing unit","Dam-break flow; Finite volume method; Graphics processing unit; OpenACC; Parallel computation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009365852"

The classic ramp metering algorithm ALINEA dominates in practical applications due to its advantages in stabilizing traffic flow at a high throughput level. Although ALINEA chooses the traffic occupancy as the optimization parameter, the classic traffic flow variables (density, traffic volume, and travel speed) may be easier obtained and understood by operators in practice. This paper presents a density-based ramp metering model for multilane context (MDB-RM) on urban expressways. The field data of traffic flow parameters is collected in Chengdu, China. A dynamic density model for multilane condition is developed. An error function represented by multilane dynamic density is introduced to adjust the different usage between lanes. By minimizing the error function, the density of mainstream traffic can stabilize at the set value, while realizing the maximum decrease of on-ramp queues. Also, VISSIM Component Object Model of Application Programming Interface is used for comparison of the MDB-RM model with a noncontrol, ALINEA, and density-based model, respectively. The simulation results indicate that the MDB-RM model is capable of achieving a comprehensive optimal result from both sides of the mainstream and on-ramp. © 2017 Li Tang et al.","Application programming interfaces (API); Traffic control; Component object models; Density-based model; Intelligent transportation; Optimal results; Optimization parameter; Ramp metering algorithms; Traffic volumes; Urban expressway; Highway traffic control","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015734252"

There is a growing interest from transport researchers, policy makers, marketing and retail businesses in understanding the implications of this change. However, existing tools and techniques developed for analysing behaviour in traditional retail environments do not adequately represent emerging complexities resulting from digital innovation. In this paper, we advance existing destination and mode choice models by incorporating online channels in a unified framework. This is a critical extension to existing transport literature on destination choice which largely ignores online activity. Specifically, we develop discrete choice models using elemental store (including both online and in-store) alternatives for joint choice of channel, store, and travel mode. We demonstrate the use of a widely-accepted consumer panel dataset with minor modifications, for the first time in transport research, together with API based data mining tools that offer great potential for enrichment. The analysis focuses on grocery shopping and uses consumer data collected from two selected boroughs in London; results from multinomial logit and nested logit estimations are reported. The extension presented here provides the tools to quantify the effects of increased online shopping on traditional store formats and travel patterns. Our results showed virtual alternatives currently offer an attractive substitute among early adopters for large basket shopping mostly for high income groups. This might suggest a significant reduction in shopping trips to hypermarkets often associated with large basket shopping potentially leading to store closures. Online deliveries mostly draw from driving trips and less so from walking and public transport trips. The present study also confirmed previous findings related to smaller stores and longer travel distances being associated with declining utilities, agglomeration and competition significantly influencing store choice. © 2017","England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Application programming interfaces (API); Electronic commerce; Transportation routes; Discrete choice; Mode choice; Multi-channel shopping; Online shopping; Store choice; discrete choice analysis; electronic commerce; modeling; public transport; retailing; shopping activity; travel behavior; walking; Data mining","Destination and mode choice; Discrete choice modelling; E-commerce; Multi-channel shopping; Online shopping; Store choice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017023216"

Dominance properties of this problem are established using proof by APIs. Then, a heuristic comprised of job selection within candidate set, movement of job cluster and local search is designed to solve this problem more efficiently.

Yet, in reality, we rarely find mobile apps that fully support opportunistic Wi-Fi access. This is mainly because it is still challenging to develop delay-tolerant mobile apps due to the complexity of handling network disruptions and delays. In this paper, we present Cedos, a practical delay-tolerant mobile network access architecture in which one can easily build a mobile app. Cedos consists of three components. First, it provides a familiar socket API whose semantics conforms to TCP, while the underlying protocol, D-2 TP, transparently handles network disruptions and delays in mobility. Second, Cedos allows the developers to explicitly exploit delays in mobile apps. App developers can express maximum user-specified delays in content download or use the API for real-time buffer management at opportunistic Wi-Fi usage. Third, for backward compatibility to existing TCP-based servers, Cedos provides D-2 Prox, a protocol-translation Web proxy. D-2 Prox allows intermittent connections on the mobile device side, but correctly translates Web transactions with traditional TCP servers. We demonstrate the practicality of Cedos by porting mobile Firefox and VLC video streaming client to using the API. We also implement delay/disruption-tolerant podcast client and run a field study with 50 people for eight weeks. We find that up to 92.4% of the podcast traffic is offloaded to Wi-Fi, and one can watch a streaming video in a moving train while offloading 48% of the content to Wi-Fi without a single pause. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Complex networks; Computer programming; Internet protocols; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Semantics; Transmission control protocol; Video streaming; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless networks; Backward compatibility; Delay tolerant mobile networks; Intermittent connections; Network bandwidth; Network disruptions; Programming abstractions; Protocol translations; Wi-Fi offloading; Delay tolerant networks","Delay-tolerant networking; mobility; Wi-Fi offloading","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999098095"

As services often undergo frequent changes and updates, the corresponding REST APIs need to change and update accordingly. To allow REST APIs to change and evolve without breaking its clients, a REST API can be designed to facilitate hypertext-driven navigation and its related mechanisms to deal with structure changes in the API. This paper addresses the issues in hypertext-driven navigation in REST APIs from three aspects. First, we present REST Chart, a Petri-Net-based REST service description framework and language to design extensible REST APIs, and it is applied to cope with the rapid evolution of SDN northbound APIs. Second, we describe some important design patterns, such as backtracking and generator, within the REST Chart framework to navigate through large scale APIs in the RESTful architecture. Third, we present a client side differential cache mechanism to reduce the overhead of hypertext-driven navigation, addressing a major issue that affects the application of REST API. The proposed approach is applied to applications in SDN, which is integrated with a generalized SDN controller, SOX. The benefits of the proposed approach are verified in different conditions. Experimental results on SDN applications show that on average, the proposed cache mechanism reduces the overhead of using the hypertext-driven REST API by 66%, while fully maintaining the desired flexibility and extensibility of the REST API. © 2016 IEEE.","Controllers; Cost reduction; Hypertext systems; Navigation; Neutrons; Petri nets; Differential Cache; Hypertext Driven; Northbound API; OpenStack; REST API; REST Chart; Application programming interfaces (API)","Controller; Differential Cache; Hypertext Driven; Neutron; Northbound API; OpenStack; Petri-Net; REST API; REST Chart; SDN","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963956960"

It is a distributed system allowing continuous data archival. ArchiveDB has demanding requirements regarding performance efficiency (storage performance of 30 GB/s during experiments, expected storage amount of 1.4 PB/year), reliability (availability of 364 days/year), maintainability (testability) and portability (including change of hardware and software). Data acquisition with continuous operation and high time resolutions (up to nanoseconds scale) for physics data is supported as well as long-term recording up to 24 h/7 days for operational data (∼1 Hz rate). Moreover, all results of data analysis are stored in the archive. Another challenge, uniform retrieval of measured and analyzed data, allowing time and structure information as selection criteria, is mastered as well. The key concepts of data storage and retrieval are: (1) partitioning of incoming data in groups and stream, (2) chunking of data in boxes of manageable size covering a finite time period, and (3) indexing of data using absolute time as ordering and indexing criteria. Continuous operation of the ArchiveDB software and hardware for various systems and components relevant to Wendelstein 7-X has been done successfully for several years, thus, showing that the key requirements are satisfied. The overall data amount so far has reached 7 Terabyte over 9 years of data taking. Round-the-clock operation of the archive is in place since 5 years. Initial plasma operation OP1.1 of Wendelstein 7-X has been supported with no downtime during the whole experimental campaign. The paper describes the software engineering concepts that have been used, consolidated and refined over the years of continuing productive ArchiveDB use and development. Changes in the underlying techniques, e.g. a change of the data store, have been encapsulated via an Application Programming Interface (API). This API unifies different implementations and is also suitable for data migration. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Computer hardware description languages; Computer software portability; Data acquisition; Data handling; Database systems; Digital storage; Hardware; Indexing (of information); Reconfigurable hardware; Search engines; Software engineering; CoDaC; Continuous operation; Data archives; Data stream management systems; Java; Information management","Big data; CoDaC; Continuous operation; Data archive; Data stream management system; Java; Lambda architecture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971624262"

SDL includes an open-source software development kit (SDK) that enables a smart-device to connect to the vehicle’s human-machine interface (HMI), read vehicle data, and control vehicle sub-systems such as the audio and climate systems. It is extensible, so other convenience subsystems or brought-in aftermarket modules can be added. Consequently, it provides a platform for cyber-physical systems that can integrate wearables, consumer sensors and cloud data into an intelligent vehicle control system. As an Open Innovation Platform, new features can be rapidly developed and deployed to the market, bypassing the longer vehicle development cycles. This facilitates a channel for rapid prototyping and innovation that is not constrained by the traditional process of automotive parts development, but is rather on the timeline of software development. This allows parties other than the OEM, including third party developers, universities, and startups, to quickly integrate their applications into the car. By digitizing the controls into a programmable application program interface (API), we can incorporate machine learning and ambient intelligence to learn user preferences and needs over time and intelligently pre-set them automatically. This can disrupt the traditional model of the human machine interaction. This is particularly important as transportation moves towards autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss some specific examples using SDL to enhance the transportation experience, including intelligent air quality and climate control, enhanced radio interface, mobility service applications, and innovative intelligent vehicle features. © 2017 SAE International.","Air quality; Ambient intelligence; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Audio systems; Computer software; Control system synthesis; Embedded systems; Human computer interaction; Innovation; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning systems; Man machine systems; Open source software; Open systems; Quality control; Software design; Software engineering; Vehicles; Application program interfaces; Autonomous Vehicles; Human machine interaction; Human Machine Interface; Infotainment systems; Intelligent vehicle controls; Mobile applications; Vehicle development; Software prototyping","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018327899"

The landscape of software that is easily available to do such work is limited and lacks essential features necessary for combining elastic matter with simulations of liquids. Here we present an open source software package called Sibernetic, designed for the physical simulation of biomechanical matter (membranes, elastic matter, contractile matter) and environments (liquids, solids and elastic matter with variable physical properties). At its core, Sibernetic is built as an extension to Predictive-Corrective Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (PCISPH). Sibernetic is built on top of OpenCL, making it possible to run simulations on CPUs or GPUs, and has 3D visualization support built on top of OpenGL.

As of 2016, Facebook had over 1.65 billion users. SNS is known for challenging conventional connotations of friendship by lumping all of one's social connections, including remote acquaintances, into one uniform friend category. Research suggests that social search is the future of online search and social search is seen as the online search for persons or information on persons. Based on only the structure of SNS, this paper devises a couple of exploration techniques to predict what strategies users are going to make friends on SNS in mobile environment. Essentially, there are two strategies for making friends on SNS in mobile environment: random and non-random (friends of friends) strategies. The non-random strategy means that new friends are selected in a friends-of-friends manner. Each SNS user can select randomly chosen target user, or neighbourhood search is done to develop a social network. This study develops logit models to capture the characteristics of these choice strategies. We conduct a series of experiments related to Facebook membership. Visualising how users are linked together or not is accessible via the Facebook application programming interface (API), so that we could crawl their Facebook accounts and extract their friends' data and access all their information under their agreement. In this study we obtained the users' permission to install an application within their accounts. The study analyses 226 Facebook users who totally have 37,571 friends and 607,802 relationships. The results significantly show that the number of individuals' friends, the value of closeness function, the betweenness value, and the clustering coefficient are the four important factors when an individual makes friends on Facebook. The accuracy of our models predicting the random or non-random strategies for making friends on Facebook is 84.5%. In addition, this paper significantly verifies the small-world phenomenon or six degrees of separation on Facebook. Implications for practitioners and academics are discussed.

While huge research and development efforts have been spent on lower level networks and software technologies, it has been recognized that little experience exists instead in modeling and building applications for the Web of Things. Although several works have proposed Representational State Transfer (REST) inspired approaches for the Web of Things, a main limitation is that poor support is provided to web developers for speeding up the development of Web of Things applications while taking full advantage of REST benefits. In this paper, we propose a framework which supports developers in modeling smart things as web resources, exposing them through RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and developing applications on top of them. The framework consists of a Web Resource information model, a middleware, and tools for developing and publishing smart things' digital representations on the Web. We discuss the framework compliance with REST guidelines and its major implementation choices.

An abstract device services interface is then available instead of device commands, thus providing transparent access to devices capabilities and hiding the physical aspects of provider devices. The API has been designed to ease the remote management of IoT smart objects and was implemented as a module of an existing IoT middleware (UIoT).

The first such group to take up the effort was the Energy Management System  (EMS) Architecture Task Force. The EMS Architecture Task Force met at PES meetings roughly from 1982 to 1989. A final report was written, and the task force was disbanded. The next, much larger, effort was headed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI ) project, the Control Center Applications Program Interface (CCAPI), which started in the early 1990s. To allow the 'plug and play' capabilities sought by both the EMS Architecture Task Force and the CCAPI project, the EPRI teams began to design an application program interface (API). Instead of concentrating on the API details that have to do with a vendor?s computers, operating system, etc., the team began the effort to develop the framework for the meaning and structure of the information exchanged between the EMS database and various applications. A parallel effort that also contributed to the CIM development was the EPRI Operator Training Simulator (OTS) project, which had the goal of developing a training simulator that could be used by any EPRI member. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was chosen as the language to represent the CIM semantics. In 2006, EPRI initiated the CIM for planning models with the objective of developing a common power system network model that both operations and planning groups can use as a basis for information exchange.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computational linguistics; Computer operating systems; Computer simulation languages; Information theory; Modeling languages; Network architecture; Personnel training; Semantics; Unified Modeling Language; Application program interfaces; Common information model; Electric Power Research Institute; Information exchanges; Operator training simulator; Power system networks; Program interface; Training simulator; Energy management systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961752956"

The parallel implementation improves run-time efficiency and makes the realistic simulation of crack coalescence possible. To assess the accuracy and efficiency of the parallel code, we investigate its speedup and scalability. In addition, to validate the parallel code, experimental results for crack coalescence development sequences are compared. It is noted that this parallelized code markedly reduces computation time along with the coupling scheme. Moreover, the coupling approach used in this parallel code enables a more realistic and feasible numerical prediction of coalescing fractures. With the parallel implementation, two main types of crack coalescences between two flaws, formed by two short shear cracks and by a short central tensile segment and subsequent shear cracks are in detail discussed in terms of their development sequences. Consequently, this proposed coupled peridynamics code can be used to efficiently solve actual coalescence development sequences, thereby providing a numerical solution for fracture mechanics. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Continuum mechanics; Cracks; Efficiency; Flocculation; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Parallel programming; Central tensile segment; Crack coalescence; OpenMP; Parallel code; Shear crack; Finite element method","Central tensile segment; Crack coalescence; OpenMP; Peridynamics parallel code; Short shear cracks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975106783"

Development of classic Godunov methods based on Riemann problem solutions for such a model is difficult because of complexity in building appropriate wave structures. Non-oscillatory central (NOC) differencing schemes are attractive as they do not need to solve Riemann problems. In this paper, a staggered NOC scheme is amended for numerical solution of the two-phase shallow granular flow equations due to Pitman and Le. Simple discretization schemes for the non-conservative and bed slope terms and a simple correction procedure for the updating of the depth variables are proposed to ensure the well-balanced property. The scheme is further corrected with a numerical relaxation term mimicking the interphase drag force so as to overcome the difficulty associated with complex eigenvalues in some flow conditions. The resultant NOC scheme is implemented on multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) in a server by using both OpenMP-CUDA and multistream-CUDA parallelization strategies. Numerical tests in several typical two-phase shallow granular flow problems show that the NOC scheme can model wet/dry fronts and vacuum appearance robustly, and can treat some flow conditions associated with complex eigenvalues. Comparison of parallel efficiencies shows that the multistream-CUDA strategy can be slightly faster or slower than the OpenMP-CUDA strategy depending on the grid sizes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Confined flow; Drag; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Granular materials; Network-on-chip; Partial differential equations; Program processors; Granular flows; Graphics processing units; Inter-phase drag forces; Multi-gpu; Parallelization strategies; Shallow granular-flow model; Two phase; Well balanced; Problem solving","Multi-GPU; NOC; Shallow granular flow; Two-phase; Well-balanced property","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969190372"

The algorithm interrogates the computer-aided-design system via the vendor-neutral application programming interface Computational Analysis Programming Interface and uses the Computational Analysis Programming Interface's watertight triangulation of a modified computer-aided-design geometry to guide the movement of the structured surface mesh as the geometry changes during the optimization process. A mapping procedure is introduced that not only preserves the characteristics of the original surface mesh but also guarantees that the new mesh points are on the computer-aided-design geometry. The deformed surface mesh is then smoothed in the parametric space before it is transformed back into three-dimensional space. The procedure is efficient, in that all the processing is done in the parametric space, incurring minimal computational cost. The mesh movement tool is integrated into a three-dimensional shape-optimization framework, with a linear-elasticity volumemesh movement algorithm, a Newton-Krylov flow solver for the Euler equations, and a discrete-adjoint gradientbased optimizer. The accuracy of the computed gradients is verified through a number of examples. © Copyright 2015 by the authors.","Aerodynamics; Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Computational geometry; Computational methods; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Computer control; Computer graphics; Computer programming; Computer systems programming; Design; Geometry; Mesh generation; Optimization; Aerodynamic shape optimization; Computational analysis; Computational costs; Computer aided design systems; Programming interface; Structured surfaces; Three dimensional space; Three-dimensional shape; Shape optimization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962433229"

The CUPID code has been validated against a set of conceptual problems and experimental data. In this work, the CUPID code has been parallelized based on the domain decomposition method with Message passing interface (MPI) library. For domain decomposition, the CUPID code provides both manual and automatic methods with METIS library. For the effective memory management, the Compressed sparse row (CSR) format is adopted, which is one of the methods to represent the sparse asymmetric matrix. CSR format saves only non-zero value and its position (row and column). By performing the verification for the fundamental problem set, the parallelization of the CUPID has been successfully confirmed. Since the scalability of a parallel simulation is generally known to be better for fine mesh system, three different scales of mesh system are considered: 40000 meshes for coarse mesh system, 320000 meshes for mid-size mesh system, and 2560000 meshes for fine mesh system. In the given geometry, both single- and two-phase calculations were conducted. In addition, two types of preconditioners for a matrix solver were compared: Diagonal and incomplete LU preconditioner. In terms of enhancement of the parallel performance, the OpenMP & MPI hybrid parallel computing for a pressure solver was examined.

Thus, the Science Cloud of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is based on a data cloud and high performance computing cloud, was adopted to support the simulation of LSMs. In this paper, we take advantage of the software and hardware resources of the Science Cloud to establish a prototype system for LSM applications. First, pre-processing and post-processing are crucial components of LSMs, so we specifically designed a freely available integrated software package called 'PPLSMS' (for the pre- and post-processing of LSMs) with different scripting languages and data sets, which can be built on the cloud computing platform. Second, we developed a dedicated Web portal for LSMs based on the cloud computing platform with the representational state transfer application programming interface, which allows the operation of functions, such as parameter and data selection, model configuration, as well as customization of the output, statistics and visualization via a Web browser. Finally, some basic steps were presented to operate the Web portal for LSM applications. The system integrated data sets and approaches may serve as a practical means to facilitate the simulation of LSMs. © 2013 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Cloud computing; Data visualization; Digital storage; Interface states; Portals; Surface measurement; Websites; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cloud computing platforms; High performance computing (HPC); Land surface modeling; Post processing; Pre-processing; Representational state transfer; Software and hardwares; Distributed computer systems","Cloud computing; land surface model; post-processing; pre-processing; web portal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021821486"

Using publicly available data from Twitter’s free API (Application Program Interface), we track the adoption of popular hashtags in Nigeria during 2014. These hashtags reference online marketing campaigns, major news stories, and events and issues specific to Nigeria, including reactions to the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Northeastern Nigeria by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram. We find that hashtags related to Nigerian sociopolitical issues, including the #bringbackourgirls hashtag, which was associated with protests against the Nigerian government’s response to the kidnapping, are more likely to be adopted among densely connected users with multiple network neighbors who have also adopted the hashtag, compared to mainstream news hashtags. This association between adoption threshold and local network structure is consistent with theory about the spread of complex contagions, a type of social contagion which requires social reinforcement from multiple adopting neighbors. Theory also predicts the need for a critical mass of adopters before the contagion can become viral. We illustrate this with the #bringbackourgirls hashtag by identifying the point at which the local social movement transforms into a more widespread phenomenon. We also show that these results are robust across both the follow and reply/mention/retweet networks on Twitter. Our analysis involves data mining records of hashtag adoption and of the social connections between adopters. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Crime; Data mining; Marketing; Social networking (online); Adoption threshold; Application program interfaces; Complex contagion; Network structures; Social movements; Social reinforcement; Socio-political issues; Twitter; Complex networks","Complex contagion; Network structure; Social movements; Twitter","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84953722792"

The scheme is based on mapping procedures based on Hilbert spacefilling curves (HSFC). Design/methodology/approach - The methodology uses domain decomposition strategies to distribute the computation of large-scale models in a cluster. It also partitions the workload of each subdomain among threads. This additional procedure aims to reach higher computational performance by adjusting the usage of message-passing artefacts and threads. The main objective is to reduce the communication among processes. The work division by threads employs HSFC in order to improve data locality and to avoid related overheads. Numerical simulations presented in this work permit to evaluate the proposed method in terms of parallel performance for models that contain up to 3.2 million particles. Findings - Distinct partitioning algorithms were used in order to evaluate the local decomposition scheme, including the recursive coordinate bisection method and a topological scheme based on METIS. The results show that the hybrid implementations reach better computational performance than those based on message passing only, including a good control of load balancing among threads. Case studies present good scalability and parallel efficiencies.

To coordinate the on-demand task execution, we propose and implement a Run-Time System Manager (RTSM) for scheduling software (SW) tasks on available processor(s) and hardware (HW) tasks on any number of reconfigurable regions (RRs) of a partially reconfigurable FPGA. Fed with the initial partitioning of the application into tasks, the corresponding task graph, and the available task mappings, the RTSM controls system operation considering the status of each task and region (e.g. busy, idle, scheduled for reconfiguration/execution, etc). Our RTSM supports task reuse and configuration prefetching to minimize reconfigurations, task movement among regions to efficiently manage the FPGA area, and region reservation for future reconfiguration and execution. We validate the correctness and portability of our RTSM executing an image processing application on two Xilinx-based platforms: ZedBoard and XUPV5. We also perform a more extensive evaluation of its features using a simulation framework, and find that – despite the technology limitations – our approach can give promising results in terms of scheduling quality. Since our RTSM supports also the scheduling of parallel SW tasks, we use it to manage the execution of the entire parallel Edge Detection application on a desktop; we compare the application execution time with that using the OpenMP framework and find that with our RTSM execution is 2.4 times faster than the unoptimized OpenMP version. When processor affinity optimization is enabled for OpenMP, our RTMS and the OpenMP are on par, indicating that the scheduling efficiency of our RTSM is competitive to this state-of-the-art scheduler, while supporting in addition the management of HW tasks. © 2016","Application programming interfaces (API); Edge detection; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image processing; Parallel processing systems; Quality control; Scheduling; Application execution; Image processing applications; OpenMP; Partial reconfiguration; Run time systems; Scheduling efficiencies; Simulation framework; Technology limitations; Reconfigurable hardware","FPGA; OpenMP; Partial reconfiguration; Run time system; Scheduling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85001889496"

While it ensures final quality specifications it also represents a significant part of manufacturing costs. In this work we have developed cheap acrylate and acrylamide-based affinity polymers by molecular imprinting in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). This green strategy yielded ready-to-use Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) with lock-and-key affinity for a model pharmaceutical impurity, acetamide, which has potential application in API manufacturing processes. MIPs generated, along with their corresponding non-imprinted controls, were characterized by SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), ASAP (nitrogen adsorption porosimetry), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy) and particle size distribution. Static and dynamic binding and selectivity experiments were performed in order to evaluate affinity and selectivity of the polymeric matrices for the template and molecules from the same family, benzamide and pivalamide. Better adsorption affinity results were obtained for MIPs in comparison with NIPs. Methacrylamide (MAM) based MIP showed the best performance, adsorbing 2.21 mmol.g pol−1 of acetamide, when acetonitrile was used as co-solvent in the polymerization. MIPs also showed a higher selectivity for acetamide than for benzamide and pivalamide. Additionally, adsorption data were further correlated with Langmuir, Scatchard (as a second linearization form of the Langmuir model), Freundlich and Temkin equations.

In contact mechanics, the purpose of the spatial search is to find “nearest neighbors,” which is the prelude to an imprinting search that resolves the interactions between the external surfaces of contacting bodies. In particular, we are interested in the contact global search portion of the spatial search associated with this operation on domain-decomposition-based meshes. Specifically, we describe an implementation that combines standard domain-decomposition-based MPI-parallel spatial search with thread-level parallelism (MPI-X) available on advanced computer architectures (those with GPU coprocessors). Our goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of the MPI-X paradigm in the overall contact search. Standard MPI-parallel implementations typically use a domain decomposition of the external surfaces of bodies within the domain in an attempt to efficiently distribute computational work. This decomposition may or may not be the same as the volume decomposition associated with the host physics. The parallel contact global search phase is then employed to find and distribute surface entities (nodes and faces) that are needed to compute contact constraints between entities owned by different MPI ranks without further inter-rank communication. Key steps of the contact global search include computing bounding boxes, building surface entity (node and face) search trees and finding and distributing entities required to complete on-rank (local) spatial searches. To enable source-code portability and performance across a variety of different computer architectures, we implemented the algorithm using the Kokkos hardware abstraction library. While we targeted development towards machines with a GPU accelerator per MPI rank, we also report performance results for OpenMP with a conventional multi-core compute node per rank. Results here demonstrate a 47 % decrease in the time spent within the global search algorithm, comparing the reference ACME algorithm with the GPU implementation, on an 18M face problem using four MPI ranks. While further work remains to maximize performance on the GPU, this result illustrates the potential of the proposed implementation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London (outside the USA).","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer hardware; Deformation; Domain decomposition methods; Finite element method; Partial differential equations; Contact constraint; Contact problem; Global search algorithm; Hardware abstractions; Parallel implementations; Spatial searching; Thread level parallelism; Volume decomposition; Computer architecture","Contact problems; Finite element analysis; Partial differential equations; Spatial searching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961054295"

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow.

This is particularly true in systems such as oil refineries, petrochemical facilities, gas plants, and oil and gas production facilities where the flowing fluids are highly flammable. Because operating safely is of paramount importance in these industries, standards and recommended practices have been developed by trade associations such as the American Petroleum Institute Standard 521 (API 521) to aid in the analysis of the system. In the case of fire scenarios, the traditional recommendation of API 521 has been an empirical model based on the wetted area of the vessel. However, in the most recent 6th edition released in 2014, the standard added an analytical equation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law that can be used for modeling the dynamic response of pressurized vessels in fire scenarios. Using BLOWDOWN™ Technology in Aspen HYSYS, this analytical fire equation was validated with available experimental data and compared with the traditional wetted area model. This also included evaluating the effects of the parameters in the analytical equation such as surface emissivity of the equipment wall and external heat transfer coefficient, which have significant uncertainties. As plant fires can impact a wide area, this study further investigated using the analytical equation to model fire on a detailed geometry of a pressurized vessel with associated piping. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Boltzmann equation; Fires; Gas plants; Heat transfer; Hydrocarbons; Petrochemical plants; Pressure vessels; Wetting; American Petroleum Institute standards; Analytical equations; Blow down; External heat transfer; Oil and gas production; Petrochemical facility; Recommended practice; Simulation; Analytical models","Blowdown; Fire; Hydrocarbons; Pressure vessel; Simulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030254561"

All cases were tested at the single and dual-core versions of an ARM Cortex-A9 processor that is embedded in many commercial system-on-a-chip. The OVP simulator platform is used to instantiate the processor model and to inject faults into the system. Faults are modeled as bit flips in the processor registers.

In our previous work we have implemented FETI solver using MPI parallelization into our ESPRESO solver. The proposed hybrid implementation provides better utilization of resources of modern HPC machines using advanced shared memory runtime systems such as Cilk++ runtime. Cilk++ is an alternative to OpenMP which is used by ESPRESO for shared memory parallelization. We have compared the performance of the hybrid parallelization to MPI-only parallelization. The results show that we have reduced both solver runtime and memory utilization. This allows a solver to use a larger number of smaller sub-domains and in order to solve larger problems using a limited number of compute nodes.

Circuit-layout design, transportation/traffic engineering, and assigning gates to airplanes are some of the interesting applications of the QAP. In this study, we introduce an enhanced version of a recent local search heuristic, Breakout Local Search Algorithm (BLS), by using the Levenshtein Distance metric for checking the similarity of the new starting points to previously explored QAP permutations. The similarity-checking process prevents the local search algorithm, BLS, from getting stuck in already-explored areas. In addition, the proposed BLS Algorithm (BLS-OpenMP) incorporates multi-threaded computation using OpenMP. The stagnation-aware search for the optimal solutions of the QAP is executed concurrently on several cores with diversified trajectories while considering their similarity to already-discovered local optima. The exploration of the search space is improved by selecting the starting points intelligently and speeding up the fitness evaluations linearly with number of processors/threads. BLS-OpenMP has been tested on the hardest 59 problem instances of the QAPLIB, and it obtained 57 of the best known results. The overall deviation of the achieved solutions from the best known results is 0.019% on average, which is a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Application programming interfaces (API); Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Local search (optimization); Combinatorial optimization problems; Levenshtein distance; Local search; Local search algorithm; Local search heuristics; OpenMP; Quadratic assignment problems; State-of-the-art algorithms; Optimization","Breakout local search; Levenshtein distance; OpenMP; Optimization; Quadratic assignment problem","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000786703"

These methods capture the interactions between mobile apps and Android system, but ignore the communications among components within or cross application boundaries. As a consequence, the majority of the existing methods are less effective in identifying many typical malwares, which require a few or no suspicious resources, but leverage on inter-component communication (ICC) mechanism when launching stealthy attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a new malware detection method, named ICCDetector. ICCDetector outputs a detection model after training with a set of benign apps and a set of malwares, and employs the trained model for malware detection. The performance of ICCDetector is evaluated with 5264 malwares, and 12026 benign apps. Compared with our benchmark, which is a permission-based method proposed by Peng et al. in 2012 with an accuracy up to 88.2%, ICCDetector achieves an accuracy of 97.4%, roughly 10% higher than the benchmark, with a lower false positive rate of 0.67%, which is only about a half of the benchmark. After manually analyzing false positives, we discover 43 new malwares from the benign data set, and reduce the number of false positives to seven. More importantly, ICCDetector discovers 1708 more advanced malwares than the benchmark, while it misses 220 obvious malwares, which can be easily detected by the benchmark. For the detected malwares, ICCDetector further classifies them into five newly defined malware categories, which help understand the relationship between malicious behaviors and ICC characteristics. We also provide a systemic analysis of ICC patterns of benign apps and malwares. © 2016 IEEE.","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Computer systems programming; Intrusion detection; Android; Android systems; Detection models; False positive rates; Malicious behavior; Malware detection; Mobile malware; Systemic analysis; Malware","Android; ICC; Malware Detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963956647"

We demonstrate the DDM using popular libraries for solving linear algebra such as the linear algebra package (LAPACK) or the basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS).

The data publication service simplifies the process of copying data to a secure storage location, assigning data a citable persistent identifier, and recording custom (e.g., material, technique, or instrument specific) and automatically-extracted metadata in a registry while the data discovery service will provide advanced search capabilities (e.g., faceting, free text range querying, and full text search) against the registered data and metadata.

In the important three-dimensional case, the execution times indicate real-time performance. Furthermore, we show how the algorithm can be adapted for parallel execution on both CPU and GPU architectures using OpenMP, AVX, and CUDA. For large datasets, our CUDA solution is superior.

A typical example is Android Things that Google supports. Compatibility based on the same platform can provide more convenient personalization services centering on mobile devices, while this uniformity-based computing environment can expose many security vulnerabilities. For example, new mobile malware running on Android can instantly transition to all connected devices. In particular, the Android platform has a structural weakness that makes it easy to repackage applications. This can lead to malicious behavior. To protect mobile apps that are vulnerable to malicious activity, various code obfuscation techniques are applied to key logic. The most effective one of this kind involves safely concealing application programming interfaces (API). It is very important to ensure that obfuscation is applied to the appropriate API with an adequate degree of resistance to reverse engineering. Because there is no objective evaluation method, it depends on the developer judgment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scheme that can quantitatively evaluate the level of hiding of APIs, which represent the function of the Android application based on machine learning theory. To perform the quantitative evaluation, the API information is obtained by static analysis of a DEX file, and the API-called code executed in Dalvik in the Android platform is dynamically extracted. Moreover, the sensitive APIs are classified using the extracted API and Naive Bayes classification. The proposed scheme yields a high score according to the level of hiding of the classified API. We tested the proposed scheme on representative applications of the Google Play Store. We believe it can be used as a model for obfuscation assessment schemes, because it can evaluate the level of obfuscation in general without relying on specific obfuscation tools. © 2013 IEEE.","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Computation theory; Learning systems; Malware; Reverse engineering; Static analysis; Android Things; Computing environments; Naive Bayes classification; Objective evaluation; Personalization services; Quantitative evaluation; Security assessment; Security vulnerabilities; Mobile security","Android Things; mobile security; security assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028087687"

By introducing an overall data structure for mesoscopic dynamic transportation simulation, we discuss a set of implementation issues for enabling flexible parallel computing on a multi-core shared memory architecture. First, we embed an event-based simulation logic to implement a simplified kinematic wave model and reduce simulation overhead. Second, we present a space-time-event computing framework to decompose simulation steps to reduce communication overhead in parallel execution and an OpenMP-based space-time-processor implementation method that is used to automate task partition tasks. According to the spatial and temporal attributes, various types of simulation events are mapped to independent logical processes that can concurrently execute their procedures while maintaining good load balance. We propose a synchronous space-parallel simulation strategy to dynamically assign the logical processes to different threads. The proposed method is then applied to simulate large-scale, real-world networks to examine the computational efficiency under different numbers of CPU threads.

Some a priori estimates of discrete L2-norm with optimal order of convergence O(Δt2−α+h2+k2) with pressure and velocity are established on both uniform and non-uniform rectangular grids, where Δt is the time step, h and k are maximal mesh sizes of x and y-directional grids.

However, these CAM software solutions are presently unable to support fast tool/slow slide servo diamond turning of freeform surface due to difference in coordinating systems. In contrast to traditional machining processes, fast tool/slow slide servo diamond turning is controlled by both linear and angular positions of the workpiece and is known as polar or cylindrical coordinate system. Hence, a special CAM post-processor is required to generate the spiral tool trajectory in fast tool/slow slide servo diamond turning. However, these special CAM software solutions are very expensive. Manufacturers have been searching for solutions to sustain their competitive advantage in mass producing products at the shortest time to market and at a most economical cost. Hence, these drive the needs for an alternative and economical option of generating accurate tool trajectory for fast tool/slow slide servo diamond turning of freeform surfaces. This article proposes an attractive solution with an integration of Visual Basic application programming interface into SolidWorks to generate spiral tool trajectory for diamond turning of freeform surface. In this proposed methodology, the spiral tool trajectory can be extracted directly from computer-aided design models of freeform surface without utilizing any expensive CAM software.

Almost all curb-to-curb paratransit services have a significantly large pickup time window, ranging from 20 to 40 min from the scheduled time and producing substantial passenger waiting times. The arrival notification system presented in this study delivers an automated voice call to a registered user once the paratransit vehicle is in proximity to the pickup location. The system utilizes the Google Traffic application programming interface (API) for the vehicle arrival estimation. Unlike other vehicle arrival notification systems in the state of the practice, the proposed system is compact and does not require additional equipment such as radio transmitting and positioning devices. The proposed system, which uses consumer mobile devices with the Android or iOS platform, is designed to exploit commercial cellular network service (i.e., 3G and 4G-LTE). In addition to the passenger notification, the proposed system provides paratransit drivers with real-time route guidance information developed through the Google Maps API. Field evaluation conducted in Essex County, New Jersey, revealed significant reduction in passenger waiting time. The passenger waiting time was reduced by 15 to 20 min. In addition, the accuracy of the notification system was tested. During the test, in almost all cases, the vehicle arrived 1 min earlier than the proposed arrival time. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

The specialization in ASIPs often calls for extensions at the high-level languages to allow the designers to exploit the specialized capabilities. This in turn requires the frontend of the compiler to handle the new syntax and carry the intentions of the designers across to the compiler backend implementations. The backend implementations also require extra efforts for optimized uses of the specialize features of ASIPs. Meanwhile, because of the diversity of the application, it is necessary to make full use of the compiler to complete supports and to make up some shortages of ASIP processors, the corresponding library functions are increased to support of certain operations, such as floating point arithmetic that may not be supported in ASIPs. With the development of the embedded parallelism, the advanced ASIP compilers need the support of parallelism for future application. This paper describes the High-performance C Compiler (HCC) and its specific implementation for an industrial ASIP and its family processors. HCC is a C language compiler extended and retargeted from GCC. A compiler extension framework is proposed processing programming syntax extensions of standard ANSI C for the ASIPs. With target-specific implementation, the adding optimized arithmetic functions library and chips definition file (CDF) as well as the header files for corresponding ASIPs, HCC compiler could be enhanced for the processing capabilities of target processors. Finally, this paper describes a new compiler static allocation and scheduling scheme for loop parallelization based on the OpenMP specification to improve the load imbalance. We have conducted analysis and extensive experiments to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the HCC compiler with the presented ideas. The results show that HCC compiler has a stable performance with excellent codes quality and it has been used in market. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application specific integrated circuits; C (programming language); Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Digital arithmetic; Digital signal processors; Embedded systems; High level languages; Microprocessor chips; Number theory; Parallel processing systems; Specifications; Syntactics; Systems analysis; Allocation and scheduling; Application specific instruction set processor; Arithmetic functions; Library support; Loop parallelization; Multimedia applications; Processing capability; Retargeting compiler; Program compilers","Application-specific instruction-set processor; Library support; Multimedia application; OpenMP parallel specification; Retargeting compiler","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930894981"

Both fluid and particle solvers are parallel, with two levels of parallelism. The first level is based on a substructuring technique and uses message passing interface (MPI) as the communication library; the second level consists of OpenMP pragmas for loop parallelisation at the node level. When dealing with transient flows, there exist two main alternatives to address the coupling of these solvers. On the one hand, a single-code approach consists in solving the particle equations once the fluid solution has been obtained at the end of a time step, using the same instance of the same code. On the other hand, a multi-code approach enables one to overlap the transport of the particles with the next time-step solution of the fluid equations, and thus obtain asynchronism. In this case, different codes or two instances of the same code can be used. Both approaches will be presented. In addition, a dynamic load balancing library is used on the top of OpenMP pragmas in order to continuously exploit all the resources available at the node level, thus increasing the load balance and the efficiency of the parallelisation and uses the MPI. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Computational fluid dynamics; Distributed computer systems; Dynamic loads; Lagrange multipliers; Message passing; Network management; Particle separators; Respiratory system; Communication library; Dynamic load balance; Dynamic load balancing library; Lagrangian particles; Message passing interface; MPI+OpenMP; Parallelisation; Substructuring techniques; Transport properties","CFD; dynamic load balance; Lagrangian particle transport; MPI+OpenMP; parallelisation; respiratory system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987665972"

Any other similar composite system of irregular (star-shaped) particles in a matrix can also be simulated. This paper integrates two new algorithms into the Anm model. The first new algorithm is the extent overlap box (EOB) method that detects interparticle contact, and the second is the capability of adding a uniform-thickness shell to each particle. Parameter analysis has shown that the EOB method leads to a more accurate detection of interparticle contact with a smaller computational cost than the previously used Newton-Raphson method. The uniform-thickness shell provides a customizable tool to control the minimum intersurface distance of particles during the parking process, as well as to simulate processes and microstructure that are dependent on the Euclidean distance from a particle surface. For mortar and concrete, the uniform-thickness shell can represent the observed interfacial transition zone (ITZ) structure. A parallel processing application programming interface (API) was integrated into the Anm model to accelerate the particle placement process by parallel optimization, which results in significant improvements in the packing efficiency on multicore processor systems. This significant speedup as well the improved contact function and new uniform-thickness shell algorithm greatly extend the range, size, and type of particle systems that can be studied. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Aggregates; Application programming interfaces (API); Composite materials; Computer systems programming; Computerized tomography; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Harmonic analysis; Mortar; Multicore programming; Newton-Raphson method; Optimization; Parallel processing systems; Shells (structures); Interfacial transition zone; Interparticle contacts; Parallel processing; Similar composite systems; Spherical harmonic series; Spherical harmonics; Uniform-thickness shell; X-ray computed tomography; Agglomeration","Composites; Concrete and mortar; Contact function; Interfacial transition zone; Parallel processing; Spherical harmonics; Uniform-thickness shell","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959036637"

ARINC 661 contains various two-dimensional GUI (Graphical User Interface) widget definitions. The widget set covers a variety of graphics elements including circles, arcs, crowns and others. Additionally, the symbol widgets provide rendering of user defined polygonal shapes which are typically described with triangle fans and triangle strips. ARINC 661 has various rendering features including text, image output, transformation of object and the halo effect which renders the outlines of graphics objects for highlighting. It is possible to use 3D graphics libraries like OpenGL and DirectX for implementation of graphics features. However those 3D graphics libraries are too heavy and over-powered to show 2D graphics primitives defined in ARINC 661. In this paper, we propose ARINC661 rendering based on OpenVG. OpenVG is a standard of 2D vector graphics API defined by the Khronos Group. OpenVG is designed for embedded system GUI rendering and its features are appropriate to implement ARINC661. Compare with OpenGL, OpenVG defined with fixed pipeline architecture without programmable shader. Therefore, OpenVG is cost effective to rendering and certification of software quality by reducing complexity of application source code.

This paper proposes a novel approach of automating both the design and manufacturing processes of impeller-type geometries, when CAD/CAM technology is employed. To do so, a newly developed application was built; exploiting application programming interface objects of parametric instances, in order to automate time-consuming repetitive tasks for the preparation of 3D models and their direct manufacturing process. The developed application incorporates Simpson’s method, Bezier-Bernstein equation and Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline for curve approximation describing blades of centrifugal impellers, as a representative case study. The machining technology is that of 3-axis CNC, thereby; each curve extends along a constant x-y plane. In the first step of the application, the entire 3D model of the impeller-type model is automatically generated according to variable values taken as user-defined entities from the interface. The application then carries on by automatically modeling the manufacturing process and ultimately generating the NC program from the cutter location data for a given CNC machine tool. © 2015, Springer-Verlag France.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer control systems; Curve fitting; Design; Impellers; Industrial research; Life cycle; Machine tools; Manufacture; Numerical control systems; Product design; Three dimensional computer graphics; Automatically generated; Cad/cams; CNC; Developed applications; Manufacturing process; Non-uniform rational B-splines; Parametric design; Product life cycle management; Computer aided design","CAD/CAM; CNC; Manufacturing; Parametric design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922570068"

The two-phase medium is treated as a continuum and solved on an Eulerian grid, while the discrete bubbles are tracked in a Lagrangian fashion with their dynamics computed. The intimate coupling between the two description levels is realized through the local void fraction, which is computed from the instantaneous bubble volumes and locations, and provides the continuum properties. Since, in practice, any such flows will involve large numbers of bubbles, schemes for significant speedup are needed to reduce computation times. We present here a shared-memory parallelization scheme combining domain decomposition for the continuum domain and number decomposition for the bubbles; both selected to realize maximum speedup and good load balance. The Eulerian computational domain is subdivided based on geometry into several subdomains, while for the Lagrangian computations, the bubbles are subdivided based on their indices into several subsets. The number of fluid subdomains and bubble subsets matches with the number of central processing unit (CPU) cores available in a shared-memory system. Computation of the continuum solution and the bubble dynamics proceeds sequentially. During each computation time step, all selected openmp threads are first used to evolve the fluid solution, with each handling one subdomain. Upon completion, the openmp threads selected for the Lagrangian solution are then used to execute the bubble computations. All data exchanges are executed through the shared memory. Extra steps are taken to localize the memory access pattern to minimize nonlocal data fetch latency, since severe performance penalty may occur on a nonuniform memory architecture (NUMA) multiprocessing system where thread access to nonlocal memory is much slower than to local memory. This parallelization scheme is illustrated on a typical nonuniform bubbly flow problem, cloud bubble dynamics near a rigid wall driven by an imposed pressure function (Ma et al., 2013, ""Euler-Lagrange Simulations of Bubble Cloud Dynamics Near a Wall,"" International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, San Diego, CA, Nov. 15-21, Paper No. IMECE2013-65191 and Ma et al., 2015, ""Euler-Lagrange Simulations of Bubble Cloud Dynamics Near a Wall,"" ASME J.

The current computational tool would be the first step of accurate modeling of wave energy converters in which the immense energy of the ocean can be extracted at low cost. Design/methodology/approach - The full two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are discretized on a regular structured grid, and the two-step projection method along with multi-processing (OpenMP) is used to efficiently solve the flow equations. The level set and the immersed boundary methods are used to capture the free surface of a fluid and a solid object, respectively. The full two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved on a regular structured grid to resolve the flow field. Level set and immersed boundary methods are used to capture the free surface of liquid and solid object, respectively. A proper contact angle between the solid object and the fluid is used to enhance the accuracy of the advection of the mass and momentum of the fluids in three-phase cells. Findings - The computational tool is verified based on numerical and experimental data with two scenarios: a cylinder falling into a rectangular domain due to gravity and a dam breaking in the presence of a fixed obstacle. In the former validation simulation, the accuracy of the immersed boundary method is verified. However, the accuracy of the level set method while the computational tool can model the high-density ratio is confirmed in the dam-breaking simulation. The results obtained from the current method are in good agreement with experimental data and other numerical studies. Practical/implications - The computational tool is capable of being parallelized to reduce the computational cost; therefore, an OpenMP is used to solve the flow equations. Its application is seen in the following: wind energy conversion, interaction of solid object such as wind turbine with water waves, etc. Originality/value - A high efficient CFD approach method is introduced to capture the interaction of solid object with a two-phase flow where they have high-density ratio. The current method has the ability to efficiently be parallelized. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Energy conversion; Flow interactions; Flow of fluids; Navier Stokes equations; Numerical methods; Turbulent flow; Viscous flow; Water waves; Wave energy conversion; Wind power; Wind turbines; Design/methodology/approach; Fluid solid interaction; Free surfaces; Immersed boundary; Immersed boundary methods; Level Set; Two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations; Two-step projection methods; Two phase flow","CFD; Fluid-solid interaction; Free surface; Immersed boundary; Level set","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020740891"

Moreover, the influence of some characteristic parameters such as thickness, height, curvature and throat level on the frequency response of cooling towers on elastic foundations is investigated. For this purpose, a computing tool coded in MATLAB employing open application programming interface feature of SAP2000 to provide two-way data flow during execution is used to perform the analyses of hyperbolic cooling towers with supporting columns over hollow annular rafts founded on elastic subsoil. The circumferential, lateral and extensional natural frequency parameters of cooling towers are presented in tabular and graphical forms to evaluate the effects of the geometric parameters and soil–structure interaction. As far as numerical examples are considered, it can be concluded that the soil–structure interactive behavior of the tower leads to a remarkable decrease in the frequency parameter of the system compared to the fixed based condition. Moreover, the frequency parameters are considerably affected by altering geometrical parameters. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Application programming interfaces (API); Biological organs; Cooling; Cooling towers; Data flow analysis; Finite element method; Foundations; Frequency response; Geometry; MATLAB; Soils; Towers; Elastic foundation; Free-vibration analysis; Frequency parameters; Interactive behavior; Open application programming interface; Parametric study; Supporting columns; Vlasov foundation; Vibration analysis","Finite element analysis; Free vibration, Open application programming interface; Hyperbolic cooling tower; Modified Vlasov model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944532835"

It is an implicit, unstructured grid finite element code that hosts a set of advanced features that are readily combined within a single analysis run. Albany uses template-based generic programming methods to provide extensibility and flexibility; it employs a generic residual evaluation interface to support the easy addition and modification of physics. This interface is coupled to powerful automatic differentiation utilities that are used to implement efficient nonlinear solvers and preconditioners, and also to enable sensitivity analysis and embedded uncertainty quantification capabilities as part of the forward solve. The flexible application programming interfaces in Albany couple to two different adaptive mesh libraries; it internally employs generic integration machinery that supports tetrahedral, hexahedral, and hybrid meshes of user specified order. We present the overall design of Albany, and focus on the specifics of the integration of many of its advanced features. As Albany and the components that form it are openly available on the internet, it is our goal that the reader might find some of the design concepts useful in their own work. Albany results in a code that enables the rapid development of parallel, numerically efficient multiphysics software tools. In discussing the features and details of the integration of many of the components involved, we show the reader the wide variety of solution components that are available and what is possible when they are combined within a simulation capability. © 2016 by Begell House, Inc.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Computer software reusability; Integration; Machinery; Partial differential equations; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Automatic differentiations; Component based design; Finite element codes; Flexible applications; Generic programming; Multi-physics analysis; Multiphysics software; Uncertainty quantifications; Finite element method","Finite element analysis; Partial differential equations; Template-based generic programming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994691674"

An effort is made to extend a one-dimensional five-equation reduced model (Kapila et al., 2001) to compute three-dimensional hydrodynamic impact problems on modern graphics hardware. In order to deal with free-surface problems such as water waves, gravitational terms, which are initially absent from the original model, are now considered and included in the governing equations. A third-order finite volume based MUSCL scheme is applied to discretise the integral form of the governing equations. The numerical flux across a mesh cell face is estimated by means of the HLLC approximate Riemann solver. The serial CPU program is firstly parallelised on multi-core CPUs with the OpenMP programming model and then further accelerated on many-core graphics processing units (GPUs) using the CUDA C programming language. To balance memory usage, computing efficiency and accuracy on multi- and many-core processors, a mixture of single and double precision floating-point operations is implemented. The most important data like conservative flow variables are handled with double-precision dynamic arrays, whilst all the other variables/arrays like fluxes, residual and source terms are treated in single precision. Several benchmark test cases including water-air shock tubes, one-dimensional liquid cavitation tube, dam break, 2D cylindrical underwater explosion near a planar rigid wall, 3D spherical explosion in a rigid cylindrical container and water entry of a 3D rigid flat plate have been calculated using the present approach. The obtained results agree well with experiments, exact solutions and other independent numerical computations. This demonstrates the capability of the present approach to deal with not only violent free-surface impact problems but also hull cavitation associated with underwater explosions. Performance analysis reveals that the running time cost of numerical simulations is dramatically reduced by use of GPUs with much less consumption of electrical energy than on the CPU. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Benchmarking; C (programming language); Cavitation; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Computer hardware; Digital arithmetic; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Marine engineering; Parallel processing systems; Problem oriented languages; Program processors; Shock tubes; Slamming (ships); Underwater explosions; Water waves; Approximate Riemann solver; Computing efficiency; Cylindrical containers; Free surface problems; Graphics processing units; Many-core processors; Numerical computations; Performance analysis; Multicore programming","Cavitation; Marine engineering; Parallel computing; Slamming; Underwater explosion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938933988"

Secondly, by manually FLUSH after writing and INVALID before reading, the memory consistency problem was addressed and cacheable shared image data can be accessed at high efficiency. Finally, a mechanism of parallel computing on multi-core processor was introduced by adding proxy task.

This paper explores the application of Bacterial Foraging Optimization to the problem of mobile robot navigation to determine the shortest feasible path to move from any current position to the target position in an unknown environment with moving obstacles. It develops a new algorithm based on Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique. This algorithm finds a path towards the target and avoiding the obstacles using particles which are randomly distributed on a circle around a robot. The criterion on which it selects the best particle is the distance to the target and the Gaussian cost function of the particle. Then, a high level decision strategy is used for the selection and thus proceeds for the result. It works on local environment by using a simple robot sensor. So, it is free from having generated additional map which adds cost. Furthermore, it can be implemented without requirement to tuning algorithm and complex calculation. To simulate the algorithm, the program is written in C language and the environment is created by OpenGL. To test the efficiency of the proposed technique, results are compared with Basic Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and another well-known algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to give the guarantee that the proposed method gives better and optimal path. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Then, the analysis accuracy is similar to that obtained with the reproducing kernel particle approximation. Determining the index array of the global stiffness matrix requires a large amount of computer memory. We thus propose a scheme to overcome this problem using slightly more computer time but much less computer memory. A binary search is also proposed to find the support domain nodes for Gaussian points, and this method is much more efficient than the linear search one.

In the improved SAO algorithm, a new estimate of the width of Gaussian kernel functions is proposed to enhance the surrogate models for SAO. Based on the improved surrogate models, an adaptive sampling strategy is developed to balance the exploration/exploitation in the sampling process, which better balances between the competence to locate the global optimum and the computation efficiency in the optimization process. Fewer function evaluations are required to seek the optimum, which is of great significance for computation-intensive structural optimization problems. Moreover, based on scripting program languages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), integration between commercial CAD and CAE software packages is implemented to expand the applications of the SAO algorithm in mechanical practices. Two benchmark tests from simple to complex, from low-dimension to moderate-dimension were performed to validate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Even for a serial version of FEAP (a cluster version also exists) such a parallelization is a non-trivial task due to the existing architecture of this code, which complicates efficient parallelization. First, we compare the serial version of FEAP to the parallel code Warp3D (Dodds et al., 2014), considering the usage of time and memory. As we found, Warp3D is much faster but uses more memory than FEAP. An analysis of Warp3D helps us to devise our method of parallelization of the loop over elements. Next, we describe several changes in FEAP, which were necessary to parallelize the loop over elements using OpenMP. In particular, the subroutine assembling elemental matrices is identified as crucial to good performance, and several directives for the mutual exclusion synchronization of OpenMP are implemented and tested. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the parallelized FEAP, designated as ompFEAP, on numerical examples involving 3D and shell elements of FEAP as well as user’s elements. We conclude that ompFEAP, using the directive ATOMIC for synchronization of the assembling, provides a very good speedup and efficiency. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cluster computing; Codes (symbols); Elemental matrices; Existing architectures; FEAP; Mutual exclusions; Non-trivial tasks; OpenMP; Parallelizations; Shell element; Finite element method","3D and shell elements; FEAP; Finite element method; OpenMP; Parallelization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931957087"

For our examples, run times were improved by several orders of magnitude, depending on the actual chosen precision level (up to a factor of 50,000 in case of double precision).

However, during the timeout period of inactivity timers, known as the tail time, a large proportion of energy in user devices and a considerable amount of radio resources are wasted. In this paper, we propose TailTheft, a scheme that leverages the tail time for batching and prefetching to reduce energy consumption. For network requests from a number of applications that can be deferred or prefetched, TailTheft provides a customized application programming interface to distinguish requests and then schedules delay-tolerant and prefetchable requests in the tail time to save energy. TailTheft employs a virtual tail time mechanism to determine the amount of tail time that can be used and a dual queue scheduling algorithm to schedule transmissions. We implement TailTheft in the Network Simulator with a model for calculating energy consumption that is based on parameters measured from mobile phones. We evaluate TailTheft using real application traces, and the experimental results show that TailTheft can achieve significant savings on battery energy (up to 65%) and dedicated radio resources (up to 56%), compared to the default policy. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Delay tolerant networks; Energy utilization; Radio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Algorithm/protocol design and analysis; Cellular network; Inactivity timer; Network simulators; Proportion of energy; Real applications; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless communications; Computer systems programming","Algorithm/protocol design and analysis; Wireless communication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903760716"

The color images for their corresponding depth of fruit tree were taken by using RGB-D camera from multiple aspect angles. Then 3D point clouds of fruit tree in different perspectives were computed and acquired through fusing the corresponding information of its color image and depth image. And a high-efficiency point cloud registration approach was explored and tested to reconstruct 3D fruit tree's point cloud model quickly: Firstly, data preprocessing of fruit tree's each piece of point cloud was carried out for background removing and original point cloud de-noising based on depth distance judgment and spare noise filtering methods respectively, and accordingly each relative accurate data set was obtained as the fruit tree's point cloud in its each specific perspective. Secondly, the key points of each piece of point cloud were extracted using Normal Aligned Radial Feature (NARF) algorithm based on the depth and boundary information of fruit tree's point cloud, and their corresponding feature vectors were also calculated using Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH) descriptor. Thirdly, the feature vectors were compared between two adjacent pieces of point cloud and then pairs of corresponding key points were estimated and extracted. Then those pairs of corresponding key points were validated and refined using the RANdomSAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to obtain the correct space mapping relationship between two adjacent pieces of point cloud, and further the transformation parameters from one piece of point cloud to its adjacent one were computed. And then, the initial registration of two adjacent pieces of point cloud was completed by transforming them to the same coordinate system according to their transformation parameters. Fourthly, on the basis of the initial registration, the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm was implemented to achieve accurate registration for two adjacent pieces of point cloud. Finally, using the initial and precise registration algorithm mentioned above, the remaining pieces of point cloud were globally matched and 3D reconstruction of whole individual fruit tree s point cloud model was then realized. Moreover, aiming at decreasing the cost of running time of point cloud registration, a program was developed based on the acceleration of OpenMP mechanism, and the efficiency for point cloud registration process was significantly improved with precision and robustness unchanged. The experiment was carried out and the results showed that the proposed approach could be used to match pieces of point cloud at any arbitrary initial positions to reconstruct 3D point cloud for fruit tree rapidly, and its registration distance error was 0.0068 m. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

First, the numerical process of rotor blade design is analysed and a flow framework model of two-level flows and a group of nodes is proposed to integrate different discipline tools in the rotor blade design process to act as an integration mechanism. Then, some key enabling technologies of MSI are discussed by analysing integration relations of different discipline tools. Integrated work model of different type of discipline tools is given to realise the proposed flow framework. In the end, the model of MSI is realised based on Visual C++ 6.0, OpenGL and SQL SERVER database.

This technique, which uses ""directive"" or ""pragma"" statements to annotate source codes written in traditional high-level languages, is designed to permit a unified code base to serve multiple computational platforms. In this work we analyze the popular OpenACC programming standard, as implemented by the PGI compiler suite, in order to evaluate its utility and performance potential in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. We examine the process of applying the OpenACC Fortran API to a test CFD code that serves as a proxy for a full-scale research code developed at Virginia Tech; this test code is used to asses the performance improvements attainable for our CFD algorithm on common GPU platforms, as well as to determine the modifications that must be made to the original source code in order to run efficiently on the GPU. Performance is measured on several recent GPU architectures from NVIDIA and AMD (using both double and single precision arithmetic) and the accelerator code is benchmarked against a multithreaded CPU version constructed from the same Fortran source code using OpenMP directives. A single NVIDIA Kepler GPU card is found to perform approximately 20× faster than a single CPU core and more than 2× faster than a 16-core Xeon server. An analysis of optimization techniques for OpenACC reveals cases in which manual intervention by the programmer can improve accelerator performance by up to 30% over the default compiler heuristics, although these optimizations are relevant only for specific platforms. Additionally, the use of multiple accelerators with OpenACC is investigated, including an experimental high-level interface for multi-GPU programming that automates scheduling tasks across multiple devices. While the overall performance of the OpenACC code is found to be satisfactory, we also observe some significant limitations and restrictions imposed by the OpenACC API regarding certain useful features of modern Fortran (2003/8); these are sufficient for us to conclude that it would not be practical to apply OpenACC to our full research code at this time due to the amount of refactoring required. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Computational fluid dynamics; Computational linguistics; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Computer programming; Computer programming languages; Finite difference method; Fluid dynamics; FORTRAN (programming language); High level languages; Image coding; Java programming language; Optimization; Program compilers; Program processors; Scheduling; Computational platforms; General Purpose GPU Programming; Graphics Processing Unit; Graphics processing units; High level interface; Openacc; Optimization techniques; Performance potentials; C (programming language)","Directive-based programming; Finite-difference method; Fortran; Graphics processing unit (GPU); OpenACC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926228701"

The application calculates 2D regular grids (electron densities and its laplacians) in a plane positioned by the user. By using bicubic interpolation and the Newton-Raphson method, the critical points at the plane can be calculated, and the gradient field and molecular graph can also be generated using the Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta method. It also permits plotting the electron density and its negative laplacian on the selected plane. Moreover, for both 2D grids, it is possible to calculate the contour maps using the ""Marching Squares"" algorithm. This application also permits finding the critical points in the 3D space. The output consist of plain text files and images in PNG, BMP and EPS (encapsulated post script) formats.

In this paper a 3D data visualization and processing framework is presented which is capable of interfacing with legacy 3D software packages and providing compatibility to a wide range of true 3D display applications. Exploiting OpenGL technologies and the performance of graphics processing units, the proposal allows the user to visualize true 3D volume from different types of graphic file formats. The method can process constructed 3D models of different formats and decompose the models into a series of image slices with different thickness, angle of rotations and rotating axis in real-time to meet the projection requirements of the swept-volume display. Boolean operations and local view redrawing methods are employed to review the shape of the interior parts of the 3D objects, which can provide users with a better understanding of the complexity and spatial relationship inside the objects. The user can browse and interact with volumetric images in an intuitive manner. Approaches are also proposed to export the image slices that can be projected onto the rotating flat screen in sequence to appear in the volumetric 3D display. Two different kinds of image files are generated, and the results show that a vector image has better quality than a bitmap image in terms of file size and time-consumption. Finally, by developing a simulation platform, the procedure of forming geometric slices into a 3D spatial image can be realized to simulate the presentation effect of a volumetric 3D display. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer graphics; Content based retrieval; Data handling; Data visualization; Display devices; Flow visualization; Program processors; Visualization; 3D data processing; Graphics Processing Unit; Interaction; Interactive projection; Rotating flat screens; Spatial relationships; Swept volume displays; Volumetric 3-D displays; Three dimensional computer graphics","3D data processing; Interaction; Swept-volume display; Visualization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937874828"

The effects of time-delayed mutual coupling between points on the surface will be ignored to avoid the numerical limitations found in other conventional time-domain techniques such as interpolation error, numerical dispersion error, etc. As a result, the scattered signals at the specular reflection point, at the edges, and at the corners can be clearly distinguished.

The second one is the architecture of the embedded system, where it is introduced as a fast and simple object processor (OP) optimized for the domain of mobile AR.

Disassembly is a critical process in the end-of-life (EOL) stage of a product. It is usually followed by sorting and then by material recovery for recycling or part recovery for reuse or remanufacturing. Manual estimation of disassembly time, through physical prototype disassembly or through Boothroyd and Dewhurst system, is time consuming and is not applicable in the early design stage. In this research, graph based data structures and related metrics are utilized to estimate complete and selective disassembly time at embodiment design stage. Selective disassembly is important when a single part of subassembly is to be recovered while the rest of the product is to be discarded. Selective disassembly time is estimated by merging particular nodes in assembly and bipartite graph and then recomputing the graph metrics. The method and algorithm presented in this paper is implemented using SolidWorks application programming interface (API) in Visual C#. Results are compared with the results obtained by Boothroyd and Dewhurst method, the error range is reasonable.

To speed up the development process and make it as transparent as possible to the programmer, parallelism is exploited through the use of Application Programming Interfaces (API). However, each one of these API implements different ways to exchange data using shared memory regions, and by consequence, they have different levels of energy consumption. In this paper, considering general purpose and embedded systems, we show how each API influences the performance, energy consumption and Energy-Delay Product. For example, Pthreads consumes 12 % less energy on average than OpenMP and MPI considering all benchmarks. We also demonstrate that the difference in Energy-Delay Product (EDP) among the APIs can be of up to 81 %, while the level of efficiency (e.g.: performance or energy consumption per core) changes as the number of threads increases, depending on whether the system is embedded or general purpose. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Application programming interfaces (API); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Multiprocessing systems; Parallel programming; Development process; Energy delay product; Energy efficiency evaluation; Energy evaluation; General-purpose systems; Multi-threading; Number of threads; Performance; Embedded systems","Embedded systems; Energy efficiency evaluation; Parallel programming; Performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928376505"

In this paper, implementation and performance-tuning details for porting an explicit marching-on-in-time (MOT)-based time-domain volume-integral-equation (TDVIE) solver onto GPUs are described in detail. To this end, a high-level approach, utilizing the OpenACC directive-based parallel programming model, is used to minimize two often-faced challenges in GPU programming: developer productivity and code portability. The MOT-TDVIE solver code, originally developed for CPUs, is annotated with compiler directives to port it to GPUs in a fashion similar to how OpenMP targets multi-core CPUs. In contrast to CUDA and OpenCL, where significant modifications to CPU-based codes are required, this high-level approach therefore requires minimal changes to the codes. In this work, we make use of two available OpenACC compilers, CAPS and PGI. Our experience reveals that different annotations of the code are required for each of the compilers, due to different interpretations of the fairly new standard by the compiler developers. Both versions of the OpenACC accelerated code achieved significant performance improvements, with up to 30× speedup against the sequential CPU code using recent hardware technology. Moreover, we demonstrated that the GPU-accelerated fully explicit MOT-TDVIE solver leveraged energy-consumption gains of the order of 3× against its CPU counterpart. © 2014 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Parallel programming; Program compilers; Graphics Processing Unit; Marching-on-in-time; Openacc; Parallel processing; Volume integral equation; Integral equations","explicit marching-on-in-time scheme; graphics processing unit (GPU); OpenACC; parallel processing; parallel programming; Time domain volume integral equation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903192928"

Although OpenCL programs are functionally portable, they do not provide performance portability, so code transformation often plays an irreplaceable role. When adapting GPU-specific OpenCL kernels to run on multi-core/many-core CPUs, coarsening the thread granularity is necessary and thus has been extensively used. However, locality concerns exposed in GPU-specific OpenCL code are usually inherited without analysis, which may give side-effects on the CPU performance. Typically, the use of OpenCL’s local memory on multi-core/many-core CPUs may lead to an opposite performance effect, because local-memory arrays no longer match well with the hardware and the associated synchronizations are costly. To solve this dilemma, we actively analyze the memory access patterns using array-access descriptors derived from GPU-specific kernels, which can thus be adapted for CPUs by (1) removing all the unwanted local-memory arrays together with the obsolete barrier statements and (2) optimizing the coalesced kernel code with vectorization and locality re-exploitation. Moreover, we have developed an automated tool chain that makes this transformation of GPU-specific OpenCL kernels into a CPU-friendly form, which is accompanied with a scheduler that forms a new OpenCL runtime. Experiments show that the automated transformation can improve OpenCL kernel performance on a multi-core CPU by an average factor of 3.24. Satisfactory performance improvements are also achieved on Intel’s many-integrated-core coprocessor. The resultant performance on both architectures is better than or comparable with the corresponding OpenMP performance. © 2015, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Application programming interfaces (API); Coarsening; Computer hardware; Cosine transforms; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Analysis-based transformation; Automated transformations; Heterogeneous programming; Improving performance; Memory access patterns; Multi core; OpenCL; Performance portability; Memory architecture","Analysis-based transformation; Multi-core/many-core CPU; OpenCL; Performance portability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946722048"

This procedure, however, is very computationally time-consuming. A major time reduction can be achieved by parallelizing the numerous computations of NCC. In this paper, two approaches for parallelization have been investigated: the OpenMP interface on a multi-CPU system and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) on a graphics processing unit (GPU). The performance of the OpenMP and GPU approaches were compared with a conventional Matlab implementation of NCC. The OpenMP approach with 8 threads achieved a maximum speed-up factor of 132 on the computing of NCC, whereas the GPU approach on an Nvidia Tesla K20 achieved a maximum speed-up factor of 376. Neither parallelization approach resulted in a significant loss in image quality of the elastograms. Parallelization of the NCC computations using the GPU, therefore, significantly reduces the computation time and increases the frame rate for motion estimation. © 2014 IEEE.","Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Image Enhancement; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Image coding; MATLAB; Motion estimation; Multiprocessing systems; Program processors; Ultrasonics; Computation time; Compute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA); Normalized cross correlation; Parallelizations; Radio frequencies; Strain imaging; Time reduction; Ultrasound data; algorithm; computer graphics; elastography; equipment; equipment design; equipment failure; image enhancement; image quality; letter; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; Graphics processing unit","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047689067"

This is the same challenge that global illumination has to cope with which is one of the fundamental topics in computational graphics.

The compression complexity increases when low-bit-rate video is required. Hence, the encoding time is often a major issue when processing a large number of video files. One of the methods to decrease the encoding time is to employ a parallel algorithm on a multicore system. In order to exploit the capability of a multicore processor, a scalable algorithm is proposed in this paper. Most of the parallelization methods proposed earlier suffer from the drawbacks of limited scalability, memory, and data dependency issues. In this paper, we present the results obtained using data-level parallelism at the macroblock (MB) level for encoder. The key idea of using MB-level parallelism is due to its less memory requirement. This design allows the encoder to schedule the sequences into the available logical cores for parallel processing. A load balancing mechanism is added to allow the encoding with respect to macroblock index and, hence, eliminating the need of a coordinator thread. In our implementation, a dynamic macroblock scheduling technique is used to improve the speedup. Also, we modify some of the pointers with advanced data structures to optimize the memory. The results show that with the proposed MB-level parallelism, higher speedup values can be achieved. © 2014, Sankaraiah et al.; licensee Springer.","Application programming interfaces (API); Encoding (symbols); Motion estimation; Multiprocessing systems; Network management; Resource allocation; Scalability; Software architecture; Video recording; Barrier; Elapse time; H.264; MB-level parallelism; Multicore architectures; OpenMP; Speedup; Video encodings; Video signal processing","Barrier; Elapse time; H.264; Load balancing; MB-level parallelism; Multicore architecture; OpenMP; Scalability; Speedup; Video encoding","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957587611"

The algorithm is based on the basis of the simplification for the manipulator and obstacles by cylinder enveloping. Based on the analysis of collision detection, the free space can be achieved which makes it possible for the entire body to avoid collisions with obstacles.

The MRISIMUL simulator imaged three different computer models: a user-defined phantom, a human brain model and a human heart model. The high computational power of GPU-based simulations was compared against other computer configurations. A speedup of about 228 times was achieved when compared to serially executed C-code on the CPU whereas a speedup between 31 to 115 times was achieved when compared to the OpenMP parallel executed C-code on the CPU, depending on the number of threads used in multithreading (2-8 threads). The high performance of MRISIMUL allows its application in large-scale analysis and can bring the computational power of a supercomputer or a large computer cluster to a single GPU personal computer. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Brain; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Female; Heart; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Phantoms, Imaging; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Application programming interfaces (API); Brain models; Computer graphics equipment; MATLAB; Personal computers; Simulators; Statistics; Supercomputers; Computational power; Computer configuration; Graphic processing unit(GPU); Large-scale analysis; Number of threads; parallel; Signal generation; Simulation platform; acceleration; article; brain; cadaver; computer analysis; computer graphics; computer model; computer simulation; controlled study; female; heart; human; human tissue; image display; intermethod comparison; microcomputer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phantom; signal processing; simulator; Magnetic resonance imaging","Graphic processing unit (GPU); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); parallel; simulator","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896124899"

The effect of CPU cache size in multicore computers on performance, however, has attracted little attention in lubrication and engineering analyses. In this study, the effect of cache size on the computational performance of two parallel iterative methods in solving two Reynolds equations is examined. Four computers, with CPU cache size from 4 to 40 MB and the number of processor cores from 4 to 16, were used. The sizes of the numerical grid were selected to simulate large gridwork (256 × 256) to small gridwork (2048 × 2048) tasks. It is found that the size of CPU cache is a major factor influencing the parallel efficiency in using the RBSOR method. On the other hand, the SPSOR method obtains much higher parallel efficiency than the RBSOR for medium-grained tasks, regardless of the size of CPU cache. The use of the SPSOR can, therefore, provide a much better parallel computing performance than the RBSOR in the cases of having a large number of grids or in a system with limited CPU cache.

As the number of cores keeps growing in embedded systems, it becomes more important to provide programming support which considers embedded system constraints and in the meanwhile helps utilize multicore systems. So far though C still dominates embedded programming, C++ is gaining in importance in parallel programming. It is promising to support C++ for embedded multicore systems. However, embedded systems usually have tight resource budgets, and C++ is commonly considered having huge code size that embedded systems can not afford. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the code size requirement of a C++ library and propose a layered design to provide a code size aware library support. On the other hand, to utilize embedded multicore systems, we employ C++ linguistic features to facilitate embedded multicore programming. With C++, we incorporate high-level abstractions and design patterns into the programming support to enhance low-level programming APIs that can be used to exploit DSPs, SIMD instructions, and DMAs on embedded multicore systems. At last, we evaluate our C++ support with a Blur and a JPEG program. Our result on a dual-DSP platform shows that we can obtain speedups of 3.32 and 3.09 for the Blur and JPEG program, respectively. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer software; Parallel programming; Signal processing; Embedded multicore; Embedded programming; High-level abstraction; Linguistic features; Parallel design patterns; Programming models; Programming support; Embedded systems","Embedded multicore systems; Parallel design patterns; Programming models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899625812"

The links of the robots have been approximated geometrically by using the swept sphere volume which presents tight modelling. Moreover, it is extremely easy to check for collisions and, therefore, feasible for on-line applications.

This research presents a multiresponse structural parameter estimation method for the automated FE model updating using data obtained from a set of nondestructive tests conducted on a laboratory bridge model. Both stiffness and mass parameters are updated at the element level, simultaneously. Having measurement and modeling errors is an inevitable part of data acquisition systems and finite element models. The presence of these errors can affect the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Therefore, an error sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was used to study the input-output error behavior of each parameter based on the load cases and measurement locations of the nondestructive tests. Given the measured experimental responses, the goal was to select the unknown parameters of the FE model with high observability that leads to creating a well-conditioned system with the least sensitivity to measurement errors. A data quality study was performed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the measured data. Based on this study, a subset of the most reliable measured data was selected for the FE model updating. The selected subset of higher quality measurements and the observable unknown parameters were used for FE model updating. Three static and dynamic error functions were used for structural parameter estimation using the selected measured static strains, displacements, and slopes as well as dynamic natural frequencies and associated mode shapes. The measured data sets were used separately and also together for multiresponse FE model updating to match the predicted analytical response with the measured data. The FE model was successfully calibrated using multiresponse data. Two separate commercially available software packages were used with real-time data communications utilizing Application Program Interface (API) scripts. This approach was efficient in utilizing these software packages for automated and systematic FE model updating. The usefulness of the proposed method for automated finite element model updating at the element level is shown by being able to lead to simultaneous estimation of the stiffness and mass parameters using experimental data. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Automation; Damage detection; Data acquisition; Errors; Frequency estimation; Intelligent systems; Measurement errors; Modal analysis; Monte Carlo methods; Nondestructive examination; Observability; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Software packages; Stiffness; Structural health monitoring; Testing; Application program interfaces; Finite element model calibrations; Finite-element model updating; Monte carlo analysis; Multiresponse; Non-destructive test; Real-time data communication; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Finite element method","Finite element model calibration; Monte carlo analysis; Multiresponse parameter estimation; Nondestructive test data; Parameter estimation; Simultaneous stiffness and mass parameter estimation; Structural health monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939824990"

However, the conventional MPM commonly uses a regular background grid with uniform cells, which is not apposite for localized extreme deformation problems from the view point of computation efficiency, where, in fact, a local refined background grid is preferable. Hence, a mesh-grading material point method (MGMPM) is proposed here for such problems to supply MPM with the ability for local refinement simulation. The edge displacement continuity associated with mesh grading is embedded in the nodal shape functions. Besides, the truss element is incorporated into MGMPM to model the steel reinforcement bars in reinforced concrete impacting problems, based on our previous work.

The subsystem synthesis method provides independent computation of each suspension subsystem module, and so is ideally suited for parallel processing. For parallel program implementation, OpenMP API (Application program interface) for a shared memory multi-core CPU was utilized. Three different parallel implementations were applied to examine the performance of parallel processing. In the first, parallel processing was applied only to the identified parallel regions in the subsystem synthesis method within the integration time loop. In the second, parallel processing was applied from the beginning of the program in order to avoid overhead due to the creation of parallel threads in every time step. The 3rd implementation was the same as the 2nd one, except that unnecessary data synchronization overhead was removed. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed parallel processing, parallel programs with three different implementations were created for a 6 x 6 unmanned robot vehicle model. Rough terrain run simulations were carried out. Performances of the 1st and 2nd implementation methods were worse than that of the sequential program.

The A2A view factors are computed from the defining surface integral by Gaussian quadrature. The values of the integrand, i.e. the point-to-area view factors, are computed using an OpenGL-based hemicube (HC) method to efficiently solve the obstruction problem by exploiting the hardware-accelerated visibility testing on modern graphics cards. The final steps to maximize hardware usage are rendering the HC and performing the numerical quadrature in parallel such that data transfer times are completely shadowed by computations. To demonstrate the power of our approach we compute the A2A view factor matrices for a warehouse equipped with ceramic infrared heaters and a test cabin conforming to EN 442 containing a section of a panel radiator. To judge the quality of the results we measure the deviation from unity of the area-weighted column sums of the view factor matrix and the error in radiant flux balance.

The geometric correspondence between the object mass center and its projection on 2D camera image is used to estimate object position. To hypothesize possible azimuths of the object, the 3D CAD model is off-screen rendered with OpenGL ES at different azimuths under an assumed inclination constraint provided by the inertial sensors of mobile devices, and compared with input image by contours matching. Unlike most recognition methods based on machine learning and natural features detection, which require large databases of real images and heavy computational consumption, our method only needs the CAD model of the 3D object in offline stage, and is computationally suitable for mobile devices.

When performing parallel computation on the shared memory machines, the convergence performance for solving high-Reynolds number flow with LU-SGS implicit scheme is ruined by the interface between different sub-domains divided by OpenMP parallelization. In order to improve the compatibility between OpenMP parallel environment and the implicit LU-SGS time-stepping scheme, a grid reordering method for unstructured hybrid grids is proposed. In this method, the structured-grid cells in the viscous layer near-body surface are reordered along the normal direction (like columns) and the unstructured part is reordered layer by layer according to the neighboring relations.

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods.

The aim of this research is to develop a location-based service (LBS) application to help PnR users choose the best train station to use to reach their destination using a multicriteria decision making model. A fuzzy logic method is used to estimate parking availability when a user is estimated to arrive at a PnR facility.

SRBF distinguishingly features two-loops searching strategy, the ""inner loop"" and the ""outer loop"". The ""inner loop"" aims to search a feasible point through updating the factors of the augmented Lagrangian function. With the improved significant sampling space (ISSS) method, the ""outer loop"" sequentially generates new additional samples to update the RBF model. The continuous relaxation method is developed to deal with the mixed-discrete variables during the truss structure optimization. Applied to practical truss structure optimization problems from small scale to large scale, the proposed framework demonstrates feasibility of the CAD/CAE integration system during the structure modeling and analysis, and facilitates the truss structure optimization process. The comparison results between the SRBF and other approaches show that SRBF improves merit of searching global optimum and reduces the computation cost. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer aided engineering; Computer systems programming; Constrained optimization; Integral equations; Integration; Radial basis function networks; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Computer systems programming; Constrained optimization; Functions; Integral equations; Integration; Radial basis function networks; Shape optimization; Trusses; Augmented Lagrangian functions; CAD-CAE integrations; Continuous relaxation; Meta model; Radial basis functions; Searching strategy; Structure modeling; Truss-structure optimization; Additional samples; Computer aided design; Structural optimization","Adaptive metamodel; CAD-CAE integration; Metamodel-based optimization; Radial basis function; Truss structure optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905594387"

In this article, an integrated framework is presented to perform the design optimization of solid rocket motor propellant grains. In the proposed framework, the level set method is adapted to solid propellant burnback analysis and this technique does not have any restriction on the grain configuration and is capable of handling grains of multi-stage and various burning forms. Along with the level set method, a dedicated algorithm is developed using application programming interfaces of commercial computer-aided design software to transform the initial grain shape into a special data file that can be fed to the level set codes to activate the burnback analysis. Moreover, a hybrid optimization method incorporating genetic algorithm and sequential quadratic programming is exploited to improve the grain design efficiency. Finally, two case studies have been performed to verify the feasibility and general-purpose characteristics of the proposed grain design optimization environment. The results obtained show that the proposed design framework facilitates the grain optimization process and various grain design requirements can be met.

MIROS implements the hybrid scheduler and the dynamic memory allocator. Real-time scheduling can thus be achieved with low memory consumption. In addition; it implements a mid-layer software EMIDE (Efficient Mid-layer Software for User-Friendly Application Development Environment) to decouple the WSN application from the low-level system. The application programming process can consequently be simplified and the application reprogramming performance improved. Moreover; it combines both the software and the multi-core hardware techniques to conserve the energy resources; improve the node reliability; as well as achieve a new debugging method. To evaluate the performance of MIROS; it is compared with the other WSN OSes (TinyOS; Contiki; SOS; openWSN and mantisOS) from different OS concerns. The final evaluation results prove that MIROS is suitable to be used even on the tight resource-constrained WSN nodes. It can support the real-time WSN applications.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved.

Residing at the forefront of advancements in multiprocessor technology, GPUs are often chosen as co-processors when intensive parts of applications need to be computed. Among the various domains, the scientific area of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a potential candidate that could significantly benefit from the utilization of many-core GPUs. In order to investigate this possibility, we herein evaluate the performance of a high order accurate method for the simulation of compressible flows.Targeting computer systems with multiple GPUs, the current implementation and the respective performance evaluation are taking place on a GPU cluster. With respect to using these GPUs, this paper offers an alternative to the mainstream approach of message passing by considering shared memory abstraction. In the implementations presented in this paper, the updates on shared data are not explicitly coded by the programmer across the simulation phases, but are propagated through Software Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM). This way, we intend to preserve a unified memory view that extends the memory hierarchy from the node level to the cluster level. Such an extension could significantly facilitate the porting of multithreaded codes at GPU clusters. Our results indicate that the presented approach is competitive with the message passing paradigm and they lay grounds for further research on the use of shared memory abstraction for future GPU clusters. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Computational fluid dynamics; Computer graphics; Memory architecture; Compressible turbulence; Gpu clusters; High order simulations; Intel Cluster OpenMP; MPI; Multi-gpu; Pleiad; Software distributed shared memory; Program processors","Compressible turbulence; GPU clusters; High order simulations; Intel Cluster OpenMP; MPI; Multi-GPU processing; Pleiad; Software Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893498964"

This is addressed in the present paper by devising a hybrid programming model to create a heterogeneous data-parallel computation with a single source code. The concept is demonstrated for a one-dimensional spectral-element discretization of a fluid dynamics problem. To exploit the additional hardware available when coupling GPGPU-accelerated processes with excess CPU cores, a straight-forward load balancing model for such heterogeneous environments is developed.

The CUIntegration can integrate vehicle models of conventional vehicles as well as AFVs developed with MATLAB-Simulink, and a roadway network model developed with traffic microscopic simulation software VISSIM. The architecture of this simulator is discussed in this paper along with a case study in which the simulator was utilized for evaluating a routing strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs). The authors developed a route optimization algorithm to guide an AFV based on that AFV driver's choice, which included; finding a route with minimum (1) travel time, (2) energy consumption or (3) a combination of both. The Application Programming Interface (API) was developed using Visual Basic to simulate the vehicle models/algorithms developed in MATLAB and direct vehicles in a roadway network model developed in VISSIM accordingly. The case study included a section of Interstate 83 in Baltimore, Maryland, which was modeled, calibrated and validated. The authors considered a worst-case scenario with an incident on the main route blocking all lanes for 30. min. The PHEVs and EVs were represented by integrating the MATLAB-Simulink vehicle models with the traffic simulator. The CUIntegration successfully combined vehicle models with a roadway traffic network model to support a routing strategy for PHEVs and EVs. Simulation experiments with CUIntegration revealed that routing of PHEVs resulted in cost savings of about 29% when optimized for the energy consumption, and for the same optimization objective, routing of EVs resulted in about 64% savings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative fuels; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer systems programming; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; MATLAB; Routing algorithms; Simulators; Traffic control; Travel time; Vehicle actuated signals; Visual BASIC; Alternative fuel vehicles; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Integrated simulators; Microscopic simulation; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Routing; Traffic network models; Traffic simulations; algorithm; alternative fuel; computer simulation; electric vehicle; energy use; network analysis; optimization; traffic management; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","Alternative fuel vehicles; Electric vehicles; Integrated simulator; Network wide simulation; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Routing; Traffic simulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896343776"

A BCI system detects electrical signals produced from the human brain and converts them into control signals to operate a device by reading the user’s thoughts. In this paper, we propose a prototype of an automatic control system (ACS) that controls vehicle sensors through the application of a BCI to a vehicle system for remote sensor control. The proposed system is designed and implemented using several components, including a BCI device, a server system, a smart app, and a car control panel, so that it can be applied to smart car operations. The BCI device is used to transmit a user’s brain waves through an Arduino UNO board to a server system and it also provides a Bluetooth interface. The server system receives digital brain wave signals from the BCI device and presents them in a graph. The smart app receives normalized brain waves from the server system by the Bluetooth protocol and controls the smart car through a control panel by using brain wave information. The control panel of the smart car uses an ATMega128 board to operate the vehicle based on commands from the smart app through Bluetooth. The proposed BCI-based automatic control system (B-ACS) can be applied to short-range transport models for disabled users and it is expected to be of great assistance in improving the quality of their daily lives. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Bluetooth; Control engineering; Control systems; Electroencephalography; Fast Fourier transforms; Man machine systems; Process control; Vehicles; Bluetooth protocol; Control panels; Control signal; Electrical signal; OpenGL; Prototype designs; Transport models; Vehicle sensors; Brain computer interface","Automatic control system; BCI; Bluetooth; EEG; FFT; OpenGL","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84912574660"

In particular, the Voronoi diagram of three-dimensional spheres, also called the additively-weighted Voronoi diagram, has proven its powerful capabilities for solving the spatial reasoning problems for the arrangement of atoms in both molecular biology and material sciences. In order to solve application problems, the dual structure, called the quasi-triangulation, and its derivative structure, called the beta-complex, are frequently used with the Voronoi diagram itself. However, the Voronoi diagram, the quasi-triangulation, and the beta-complexes are sometimes regarded as somewhat difficult for ordinary users to understand.

The simulation software FrontFlow/red-Aero was fully optimized on the K computer to utilize up to 10,000 processors with tens of thousands of cores. A hybrid parallelization method using MPI among processors and OpenMP among cores inside each processor was adopted. The code was specially tuned for unsteady aerodynamic simulation including large-eddy simulation, and low Mach number approximation was adopted to avoid excessive iterations usually required for the fully incompressible algorithm. The automated mesh refining system was developed to generate unstructured meshes of up to 10 billion cells. In the system, users only generate unstructured meshes in the order of tens of millions of cells directly using commercial preprocessing software. Then the original elements are refined in the preconditioning process using the K computer, and billions of cells are automatically generated. In the same way, the CFD results of the billions of elements are mapped on the original coarse grid points during post processing, and the users can transport the data from the K computer without any difficulty visualizing the results using conventional post-processing software. The simulation framework was validated on vehicles with different rear slant angles, and dependence of the aerodynamic forces on the unstructured-mesh resolution as well as the grid topology near the body surface was discussed. It was demonstrated that the simulation of the multi-billion cell mesh on the K computer agreed with wind-tunnel measurements within a small percentage of error, and validity of the fully unstructured finite volume method using multi-billion cells was confirmed.

These novel mobile phone applications rely on advanced sensor information processes, which mainly involve raw data acquisition, feature extraction, data interpretation and transmission. However, the continuous accessing of sensing resources to acquire sensor data in smartphones is still very expensive in terms of energy, particularly due to the periodic use of power-intensive sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The key underlying idea to design energy-efficient schemes is to control the duty cycle of the GPS receiver. However, adapting the sensing rate based on dynamic context changes through a flexible middleware has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modular middleware architecture and runtime environment to directly interface with application programming interfaces (APIs) and embedded sensors in order to manage the duty cycle process based on energy and context aspects. The proposed solution has been implemented in the Android software stack. It allows continuous location tracking in a timely manner and in a transparent way to the user. It also enables the deployment of sensing policies to appropriately control the sampling rate based on both energy and perceived context. We validate the proposed solution taking into account a reference location-based service (LBS) architecture. A cloud-based storage service along with online mobility analysis tools have been used to store and access sensed data.

The variety and complexity of the cryptographic protocols hinder the understanding and hence the adoption of these mechanisms in practical applications.

The range of its potential applications in computationally driven research is broad; however, at present, the repository of scientific codes is still relatively limited. In this study, we describe the development and benchmarking of a parallel version of {\mmb e}FindSite, a structural bioinformatics algorithm for the prediction of ligand-binding sites in proteins. Implemented for the Intel Xeon Phi platform, the parallelization of the structure alignment portion of {\mmb e}FindSite using pragma-based OpenMP brings about the desired performance improvements, which scale well with the number of computing cores. Compared to a serial version, the parallel code runs 11.8 and 10.1 times faster on the CPU and the coprocessor, respectively; when both resources are utilized simultaneously, the speedup is 17.6.

This approach was implemented in the KIVA4 code, and used to model diesel spray combustion within a constant volume chamber. The combustion model uses a direct integration approach with a fast explicit ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver, and is additionally parallelized using OpenMP. The soot mass production within each computation cell was determined using a phenomenological soot formation model developed by Waseda University. This model was combined with the LES code mentioned above, and included the following important steps: particle inception during which acenaphthylene (A2R5) grows irreversibly to form soot; surface growth with driven by reactions with C2H2; surface oxidation by OH radical and O2 attack; and particle coagulation. The results obtained using our new model are compared to those generated using a RANS (RNG k-epsilon) model, and also to experimental data from the engine combustion network (ECN) of Sandia National Laboratories. The sensitivity of the LES results to mesh resolution is also discussed. The results show that both RANS and LES simulations predict the dispersion and vapor penetration of the injected fuel fairly well. LES generally provides flow and spray characteristics in better agreement with experimental data than RANS. It is also shown that the phenomenological soot model is useful for investigating soot particle production and distribution. The LES model was better than the RANS model at describing instantaneous soot concentration contour. © 2014 SAE International.","Application programming interfaces (API); C (programming language); Differential equations; Dust; Free radicals; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Large eddy simulation; Navier Stokes equations; Ordinary differential equations; Soot; Constant volume chamber; Ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers; Particle coagulation; Sandia National Laboratories; Soot concentration; Spray characteristics; Turbulent kinetic energy; Vapor penetrations; Combustion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84953886127"

The key behind the ease of parallelization of the SHLL method for both governing equations is the mathematical/vector splitting in each coordinate direction - this splitting results in a high degree of locality, producing a scheme which is embarrassingly parallel and well suited for the vectorization capacities offered by vector-computing architectures. Here we demonstrate this capacity using the SIMD capacities of modern CPUs, namely the Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX) capability of recent CPUs. The main feature of AVX is the capacity to perform SIMD operations on 8 floating point variables in parallel - an increase from 4 floating point variables as possible using the previous SIMD Streaming Extensions (SSE). Furthermore, since modern CPU's employ a large number of cores, we further extend the performance by using AVX on each available CPU core using shared memory (OpenMP) parallelization. We present a direction-split higher order extension to both the SHLL method and apply it to AVX through the use of intrinsic functions in the flux computation and state computation modules. High performance is obtained by ensuring that all flux computations are performed using only AVX intrinsic functions - no computations are performed in serial. Through this approach, a single workstation with 2× Xeon CPU's (16 physical cores) allows a performance increase of over 117 times that of a single core alone in the flux evaluation kernel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Digital arithmetic; Equations of motion; Finite volume method; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Program processors; Advanced vector eXtensions; AVX; HLL; OpenMP; Shallow water equations; SHLL; Vectorization; Euler equations","Advanced vector eXtensions; AVX; Euler equations; Finite volume method; HLL; Integral balance; OpenMP; Parallel computing; Shallow water equations; SHLL; Vectorization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027917120"

To fully utilize the computational power in such heterogeneous systems, Open Computing Language (OpenCL) has been proposed. A key benefit of OpenCL is that it works on various computing platforms. However, most vendors offer OpenCL software development kits (SDKs) that support their own computing platforms. The study of the OpenCL framework for embedded multi-core CPUs is in a rudimentary stage. In this paper, an OpenCL framework for embedded multi-core CPUs that dynamically redistributes the time-varying workload to CPU cores in real time is proposed. A compilation environment for both host programs and OpenCL kernel programs was developed and OpenCL libraries were implemented. A performance evaluation was carried out with respect to various definitions of the device architecture and the execution model. When running on embedded multi-core CPUs, applications parallelized by OpenCL C showed much better performance than the applications written in C without parallelization. Furthermore, since programmers are capable of managing hardware resources and threads using OpenCL application programming interfaces (APIs) automatically, highly efficient computing both in terms of the performance and energy consumption on a heterogeneous computing platform can be easily achieved. © 1975-2011 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Energy utilization; Hardware; Program processors; Hardware acceleration units; Heterogeneous computing; Heterogeneous systems; Multi-core processor; Multi-core systems; OpenCL frameworks; Parallel processing; Software development kit; Multicore programming","Embedded multi-core system; Heterogeneous computing; OpenCL Framework; Parallel processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904684770"

Design/methodology/approach - Re-written frontal solution method with a priori pivot and front sequence. OpenMP parallelization, nearly linear (in elimination and substitution) up to 40 threads. Constraints enforced at the local assembling stage. Findings -When compared with both standard sparse solvers and classical frontal implementations, memory requirements and code size are significantly reduced. Research limitations/implications - Large, non-linear problems with constraints typically make use of the Newton method with Lagrange multipliers. In the context of the solution of problems with large number of constraints, the matrix transformation methods (MTM) are often more cost-effective. The paper presents a complete solution, with topological ordering, for this problem. Practical implications - A complete software package in Fortran 2003 is described. Examples of clique-based problems are shown with large systems solved in core. Social implications - More realistic non-linear problems can be solved with this Frontal code at the core of the Newton method. Originality/value - Use of topological ordering of constraints. A-priori pivot and front sequences. No need for symbolic assembling. Constraints treated at the core of the Frontal solver. Use of OpenMP in the main Frontal loop, now quantified.

The open Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs) are also helpful in tailoring decision support systems to determine process plans. This study proposes an emergent system to generate flexible machining process plans. The proposed system considers the integration between design and manufacturing perspective to produce relevant machining process plan. The generation of process plans begins by considering the total removal volume of the raw material, estimating the removal features, thus analyzing and ordering several candidates of machining process plans.

In addition, some OpenGL speedup schemes have been proposed to improve the efficiency of this algorithm. Based on this, the GO/PO hybrid method can yield a superior performance for scattering analysis of large complex targets, especially at high frequency.

This imposes a strong evolutionary pressure on algorithms and software to efficiently utilise all levels of parallelism available on a given platform while minimising data movement. Unstructured finite elements codes have long been effectively parallelised using domain decomposition methods, implemented using libraries such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, there are many optimisation opportunities when threading is used for intra-node parallelisation for the latest multi-core/many-core platforms. The benefits include increased algorithmic freedom, reduced memory requirements, cache sharing, reduced number of partitions, less MPI communication and I/O overhead. In this paper, we report progress in implementing a hybrid OpenMP-MPI version of the unstructured finite element code Fluidity. For matrix assembly kernels, the OpenMP parallel algorithm uses graph colouring to identify independent sets of elements that can be assembled concurrently with no race conditions. In this phase there are no MPI overheads as each MPI process only assembles its own local part of the global matrix. We use an OpenMP threaded fork of PETSc to solve the resulting sparse linear systems of equations. We experiment with a range of preconditioners, including HYPRE which provides the algebraic multigrid preconditioner BoomerAMG where the smoother is also threaded. Since unstructured finite element codes are well known to be memory latency bound, particular attention is paid to ccNUMA architectures where data locality is particularly important to achieve good intra-node scaling characteristics. We also demonstrate that utilising non-blocking algorithms and libraries are critical to mixed-mode application so that it can achieve better parallel performance than the pure MPI version. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Cache memory; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Domain decomposition methods; Fluidity; Libraries; Linear systems; Matrix algebra; Message passing; HYPRE; Linear solver; Matrix assembly; MPI; OpenMP; PETSc; SpMV; Finite element method","FEM; Fluidity-ICOM; HYPRE; Matrix assembly; MPI; OpenMP; PETSc; Sparse linear solver; SpMV","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027924292"

Computer-Aided Design 39(11):1012–1024]. The proposed algorithm automatically detects and corrects the collision based on the biggest collision boxes. The collision detection algorithm is based on the bounding volume and the sweep plane approach. The collision is firstly detected by using the bounding sphere algorithm, and the colliding spheres are then further checked with the sweep plane algorithm. The change of the workpiece geometry is included in the detection process. After the collision detection, the collision data are stored. Only the biggest collision boxes (the boxes with the biggest edge in the X, Y, or Z direction) for each type of collisions are stored. The collision avoidance algorithm corrects the biggest collision based on heuristic strategy. With this strategy, when the biggest collision is corrected, most of other collisions will disappear automatically. Therefore, the time complexity of the collision avoidance strategy is considerably reduced. The algorithm has been implemented in Visual C++ and OpenGL, demonstrated for five-axis machine with two rotary axes on the table (Deckel MAHO 600e) and can be customized to apply for any five-axis CNC machines. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer aided design; Computer control systems; Signal detection; Collision detection; Collision detection algorithm; Five-axis CNC machines; Five-axis machines; Five-axis NC machining; Global collision detections; Heuristic strategy; Machine simulation; Collision avoidance","Collision avoidance; Collision detection; Five-axis NC machining; Machine simulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929678018"

However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN.

The statistical rate theory was used to describe the mass-transfer rate of the APIs at the solid-liquid interface during the dissolution process. Dissolution profiles of indomethacin, naproxen, and glibenclamide in water and in buffered solutions at pH 5.0, 6.5, and 7.2 were measured using a rotating-disk system (USP II). The specific dissolution mechanisms of the APIs, such as surface reaction and diffusion, were analyzed by applying the proposed model to identify the rate-controlling step.

Eclipse is such a framework that has been in existence for over a decade. Like many other evolving software systems, the Eclipse platform has both stable and supported interfaces (“good”) and unstable, discouraged and unsupported interfaces (“bad”). In this study, we investigate Eclipse interface usage by Eclipse third-party plug-ins (ETPs) based on whether they use bad interfaces or not. The investigations, based on empirical analysis present the following observations. First, we discovered that 44 % of the 512 analyzed Eclipse third-party plug-ins depend on “bad” interfaces and that developers continue to use “bad” interfaces. Second, we have observed that plug-ins that use or extend at least one “bad” interface are comparatively larger and use more functionality from Eclipse than those that use only “good” interfaces. Third, the findings show that the ETPs use a diverse set of “bad” interfaces. Fourth, we observed that the reason why the bad interfaces are being eliminated from the ETPs’ source code is, because (ETP developers believe) these non-APIs will cause incompatibilities when a version of the ETP is ported to new Eclipse SDK release. Finally, we observed that when developers eliminate problematic “bad” interfaces, they either re-implement the same functionality in their own API, find equivalent SDK good interfaces, or completely delete the entities in the ETPs’ source code that use the functionality from the “bad” interfaces. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computer software; API usage; Eclipse; Empirical analysis; Plug-ins; Software Evolution; Software systems; Source codes; Third parties; Application programming interfaces (API)","API usage; Eclipse; Software evolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924223158"

These three variables were examined using objective data collected through Twitter's open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We collected data concerning tweet overload through a web-based survey, and we used an ordered logistic regression analysis to examine the combined data (n = 1277). Results demonstrated that only the number of friends had a significantly positive effect on perceived tweet overload, while the number of tweets received did not produce a significant effect. Although the density of a user's egocentric network did not demonstrate any significant effect on perceived tweet overload, a significant interaction effect appeared between the number of friends and the density of this network. In other words, findings indicated that a large number of friends strengthened the network density's effect; by contrast, a smaller number of friends strengthened network density but reduced perceived tweet overload.

This paper presents the development of a Modelica library for Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based building energy simulation (ModelicaBIM library) using an Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) approach and Modelica, an equation-based OOPM language. By using the ModelicaBIM library, our project investigates system interfaces between BIM and energy simulation, which can perform semi-automatic translation from the building models in BIM to building energy modeling (BEM) using a BIM's authoring tool's Application Programming Interface (API). The ModelicaBIM library consists of OOPM-based BIM classes and OOPM-based BIM structure. OOPM-based BIM classes represent building component information. OOPM-based BIM structure consists of test case models that demonstrate (i) how building information in BIM can be transformed to OOPM and (ii) how design operations in BIM, such as changing a building geometry and editing building components, can be translated into BEM. A case study for simulation result comparisons has been conducted using (i) OOPM-based BIM models in the ModelicaBIM library and (ii) LBNL Modelica Buildings library (a Modelica-based building thermal simulation library developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory).

In contrast, we present here runtime software support for cost-effective countermeasures against hardware timing failures during system operation. We propose a variability-aware OpenMP (VOMP) programming environment, suitable for tightly-coupled shared memory processor clusters, that relies upon modeling across the hardware/software interface. VOMP is implemented as an extension to the OpenMP v3.0 programming model that covers various parallel constructs, including task, sections, and for. Using the notion of work-unit vulnerability (WUV) proposed here, we capture timing errors caused by circuit-level variability as high-level software knowledge. WUV consists of descriptive metadata to characterize the impact of variability on different work-unit types running on various cores. As such, WUV provides a useful abstraction of hardware variability to efficiently allocate a given work-unit to a suitable core for execution. VOMP enables hardware/software collaboration with online variability monitors in hardware and runtime scheduling in software. The hardware provides online per-core characterization of WUV metadata. This metadata is made available by carefully placing key data structures in a shared L1 memory and is used by VOMP schedulerss. Our results show that VOMP greatly reduces the cost of timing error recovery compared to the baseline schedulers of OpenMP, yielding speedup of 3%-36% for tasks, and 26%-49% for sections. Further, VOMP reaches energy saving of 2%-46% and 15%-50% for tasks, and sections, respectively. © 2014 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Error detection; Hardware; Metadata; Microelectronics; Recovery; Timing circuits; OpenMP; Processor cluster; Robust system design; Timing errors; Variability management; variations; Scheduling","Cross-layer variability management; OpenMP; processor clusters; recovery; robust system design; scheduling; timing errors; variations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903268562"

Ontologies, open standards, and interoperable designs were envisioned to empower a harmonized approach to European research in nanotechnology. This setting provides a number of opportunities and challenges in the representation of nanomaterials data and the integration of ENM information originating from diverse systems. Within this cluster, eNanoMapper works towards supporting the collaborative safety assessment for ENMs by creating a modular and extensible infrastructure for data sharing, data analysis, and building computational toxicology models for ENMs. Results: The eNanoMapper database solution builds on the previous experience of the consortium partners in supporting diverse data through flexible data storage, open source components and web services. We have recently described the design of the eNanoMapper prototype database along with a summary of challenges in the representation of ENM data and an extensive review of existing nano-related data models, databases, and nanomaterials-related entries in chemical and toxicogenomic databases. This paper continues with a focus on the database functionality exposed through its application programming interface (API), and its use in visualisation and modelling. Considering the preferred community practice of using spreadsheet templates, we developed a configurable spreadsheet parser facilitating user friendly data preparation and data upload. We further present a web application able to retrieve the experimental data via the API and analyze it with multiple data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: We demonstrate how the eNanoMapper database is used to import and publish online ENM and assay data from several data sources, how the ""representational state transfer"" (REST) API enables building user friendly interfaces and graphical summaries of the data, and how these resources facilitate the modelling of reproducible quantitative structure-activity relationships for nanomaterials (NanoQSAR). © 2015 Jeliazkova et al.","Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Database systems; Graphical user interfaces; Information management; Interface states; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Molecular graphics; Nanostructured materials; Open source software; Safety testing; Spreadsheets; Web services; Computational infrastructure; Engineered nanomaterials; Nanoinformatics; NanoQSAR; Nanosafety; Open-source components; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Representational state transfer; Digital storage","Database; EU NanoSafety Cluster; Nanoinformatics; Nanomaterials ontology; Nanomaterials;; NanoQSAR; Safety testing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947938601"

Inefficient resource sharing on the chip can have a negative impact on the performance of an application and may result in greater energy consumption. A large body of research now focuses on reconfigurable multicore architectures in order to support algorithms to find optimal solutions for improved energy and throughput balance. An ideal system would be able to optimize such reconfigurable systems to a level that optimum resources are allocated to a particular workload and all the other underutilized resources remain inactive for greater energy savings. This paper presents a fuzzy logic based reconfiguration engine targeted to optimize a multicore architecture according to the workload requirements for optimum balance between power and performance of the system. The proposed fuzzy logic reconfiguration engine is designed around a 16-core SCMP architecture comprising of reconfigurable cache memories, power gated cores and adaptive on-chip network routers for minimizing leakage energy effects for inactive components. A coarse grained architecture was selected for being able to reconfigure faster, thus making it feasible to be used for runtime adaptation schemes.

At the same time, CPU architectures have evolved into the multi-core era and applications are expected to make full use of all available resources. Applications in the data acquisition domain based on the standard socket library running in a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture are unable to reach full efficiency and scalability without the software being adequately aware about the IRQ (Interrupt Request), CPU and memory affinities. During the first long shutdown of LHC, the CMS DAQ system is going to be upgraded for operation from 2015 onwards and a new software component has been designed and developed in the CMS online framework for transferring data with sockets. This software attempts to wrap the low-level socket library to ease higher-level programming with an API based on an asynchronous event driven model similar to the DAT uDAPL API. It is an event-based application with NUMA optimizations, that allows for a high throughput of data across a large distributed system.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid mechanism to recognize underwater obstacles for AUV based on fuzzy domain ontology and support vector machine (SVM). SVM is an efficient algorithm that was developed for recognizing 3D object in recent years and is a new generation learning system based on recent advances in statistical learning theory. The amalgamation of fuzzy domain ontology with SVM boosts the performance of the obstacle recognition module by providing the timely semantic domain information of the surrounding circumstances. Also the reasoning ability of the fuzzy domain ontology can expedite the obstacle avoidance process. In order to evaluate the performance of the system, we developed a prototype simulator based on OpenGL and VC++.

However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies - descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics - for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies' delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research.

The properties of such sheets differ significantly from those of conventionally rolled sheets. It is hence desirable to have a simulation framework that can accurately predict the material properties, including the evolving texture and anisotropy during processing. Here, we propose such a framework for multiple pass rolling using explicit finite elements and embedding the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal texture model for the material response. To facilitate multiple pass rolling, we propose a novel solution mapping scheme that transfers the material state from the deformed finite element mesh to a new one. Additionally, we implement a two-level parallelization scheme - with decomposition of the FE domain using message passing interface (MPI) and thread based parallelization of the material response using openMP - to ensure reduced simulation times. The predictive capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated by simulating the accumulative roll bonding of aluminum alloy AA5754 sheets. The simulations validate the working of the solution mapping scheme, and clearly show the development of a through thickness gradient of texture and anisotropy in the roll-bonded sheet after two passes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum; Anisotropy; Application programming interfaces (API); Bonding; Damage detection; Interfaces (materials); Mapping; Message passing; Strength of materials; Textures; Accumulative roll bonding; Multilevels; Multiple pass rolling; Ultra-fine grained ( UFG); Visco-plastic self-consistent; Roll bonding","Accumulative roll bonding (ARB); Finite element (FE) multi-level parallelization; Multiple pass rolling; Solution variables mapping; Ultra-fine-grained (UFG) aluminum; Visco plastic self-consistent (VPSC)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924114458"

To achieve this estimation, TProf apportions the total processor energy among cores and overcomes the limitation of current works which would otherwise make parallel accounting impossible to achieve. We demonstrate the value of TProf by characterizing a set of task parallel programs, where we find that data locality, memory access patterns and task working sets are responsible for significant variance in energy consumption between seemingly homogeneous tasks.

In this paper, we consider the global earliest deadline first (GEDF) scheduling policy for task sets consisting of parallel tasks. Each task can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent computational work and edges represent dependences between nodes. In this model, we prove that GEDF provides a capacity augmentation bound of$$4-\frac{2}{m}$$4-2m and a resource augmentation bound of$$2-\frac{1}{m}$$2-1m. The capacity augmentation bound acts as a linear-time schedulability test since it guarantees that any task set with total utilization of at most $$m/(4-\frac{2}{m})$$m/(4-2m) where each task’s critical-path length is at most $$1/(4-\frac{2}{m})$$1/(4-2m) of its deadline is schedulable on $$m$$m cores under GEDF. In addition, we present a pseudo-polynomial time fixed-point schedulability test for GEDF; this test uses a carry-in work calculation based on the proof for the capacity bound. Finally, we present and evaluate a prototype platform—called PGEDF—for scheduling parallel tasks using global earliest deadline first (GEDF). PGEDF is built by combining the GNU OpenMP runtime system and the $$\text {LITMUS}^\text {RT}$$LITMUSRT operating system. This platform allows programmers to write parallel OpenMP tasks and specify real-time parameters such as deadlines for tasks. We perform two kinds of experiments to evaluate the performance of GEDF for parallel tasks. (1) We run numerical simulations for DAG tasks. (2) We execute randomly generated tasks using PGEDF. Both sets of experiments indicate that GEDF performs surprisingly well and outperforms an existing scheduling techniques that involves task decomposition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Directed graphs; Experiments; Multicore programming; Multiprocessing systems; Polynomial approximation; Real time systems; Response time (computer systems); Scheduling algorithms; Capacity augmentation bound; Global edf; Parallel scheduling; Real - time scheduling; Resource augmentation; Scheduling","Capacity augmentation bound; Global EDF; Parallel scheduling; Real-time scheduling; Resource augmentation bound","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931009783"

The bigger is a semitrailer truck with 40 degrees of freedom (DOF). Two topological and semirecursive formulations are used as well as a global formulation based on the use of Euler parameters and flexible joints. The first semirecursive formulation carries out a double velocity transformation and the integration is done by means of the explicit fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The second semirecursive formulation and the global one use a penalty scheme at position level and orthogonal projections at velocity and acceleration levels. In both cases the integrator was the implicit Hilbert-Huges-Taylor (HHT) method. The double velocity transformation method involves the coordinate partitioning of the constraint Jacobian matrix which leads to the costly solution of a redundant but consistent with the constraints linear system of equations. The choice of a unique set of independent coordinates may not be valid for a complete simulation and additional repartitioning would be required. Based on previous experience and as the examples show in this article, a careful initial choice of the independent coordinates can remain valid for complete simulations involving common maneuvers. This represents a numerical advantage for dense matrix methods and can be further exploited if sparse matrix techniques are employed. This has been the case for both of the vehicles used, reaching real-time simulations even with the semitrailer truck. The implicit semirecursive formulation involves the numerical evaluation of the stiffness and damping matrices, which hamper obtaining real-time simulations. For the semitrailer truck, this computation represents the 76% of the total simulation time. The numerical computation of these matrices is carried out by columns and its algorithm is straightforwardly parallelizable. Using a quad-core processor and with a simple and efficient OpenMP implementation, it has been possible to achieve a speedup of 3.25 reducing the simulation times under the real-time limit. The sparse matrices of Euler parameters formulation show very different sparsity degrees, difference that grows with the size of the multibody model. This poses a challenge to sparse matrix implementations in order to be able to efficiently perform matrix operations without increasing fillings or handling zero entries. This has been successfully accomplished using a new sparse matrix representation.

To deal with the singular integral kernels, two common approaches including the semi-analytic and fully numerical schemes are used.

Design/methodology/approach - To find the best solver, the authors compare six Krylov solvers, namely, Conjugate Gradient method (CG), Scaled Conjugate Gradient method (SCG), Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) method, Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS) method with Symmetric Lanczos Algorithm (SLA) method and Incomplete Cholesky Conjugate Gradient method (ICCG) in terms of convergence, time consumption, parallel efficiency and memory consumption for the semiimplicit particle method. The MPS method is parallelized by the hybrid Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP)/Message Passing Interface (MPI) model. The dam-break flow and channel flow simulations are used to evaluate the performance of different solvers. Findings - It is found that CG converges stably, runs fastest in the serial way, uses the least memory and has highest OpenMP parallel efficiency, but its MPI parallel efficiency is lower than SLA because SLA requires less synchronization than CG. Originality/value - With all these criteria considered and weighed, the recommended parallel solver for the MPS method is CG. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computational methods; Efficiency; Poisson equation; Hybrid openmp/mpi; Krylov subspace solvers; Moving particle semiimplicit method; Parallelizations; Particle methods; Pressure Poisson equation; Conjugate gradient method","Hybrid openmp/mpi; Krylov subspace solver; Moving particle semi-implicit method; Parallelization; Particle method; Pressure poisson equation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988274622"

The objective of such systems is to optimize both performance and power characteristics of mobile devices. However, currently there are no power metrics supporting popular application design platforms (such as SID) that application developers use to develop their applications. This hinders the ability of application developers to optimize power consumption. In this article we present the design and experiments of a SIDbased power-aware simulation framework for embedded multicore systems. The proposed power estimation flow includes two phases: IP-level power modeling and power-aware system simulation. The first phase employs PowerMixerIP to construct the power model for the processor IP and other major IPs, while the second phase involves a power abstract interpretation method for summarizing the simulation trace, then, with a CPE module, estimating the power consumption based on the summarized trace information and the input of IP power models. In addition, a Manager component is devised to map each digital signal processor (DSP) component to a host thread and maintain the access to shared resources. The aim is to maintain the simulation performance as the number of simulated DSP components increases. A power-profiling API is also supported that developers of embedded software can use to tune the granularity of power-profiling for a specific code section of the target application. We demonstrate via case studies and experiments how application developers can use our SID-based power simulator for optimizing the power consumption of their applications. We characterize the power consumption of DSP applications with the DSPstone benchmark and discuss how compiler optimization levels with SIMD intrinsics influence the performance and power consumption. A histogram application and an augmented-reality application based on human-face-based RMS(recognition, mining, and synthesis) application are deployed as running examples on multicore systems to demonstrate how our power simulator can be used by developers in the optimization process to illustrate different views of power dissipations of applications. © 2015 ACM.","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Augmented reality; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Integrated circuit design; Power management; Simulators; Abstract interpretations; Augmented reality applications; Compiler optimizations; Digital signal processors (DSP); Embedded processors; Multicore simulations; Power model; Simulation performance; Benchmarking","Dsp; Embedded processor; Multicore simulation; Power modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924019804"

The rigid parts in the system are described through the Natural Coordinate Formulation (NCF) and the flexible bodies in the system are modeled via the finite elements of Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation (ANCF), which can lead to a constant mass matrix for the derived system equation of motion. For modeling composite laminated plates accurately, a new composite laminated plate element of ANCF is proposed and the corresponding efficient formulations for evaluating both the elastic force and its Jacobian of the element are derived from the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. To improve computational efficiency, the sparse matrix technology and graph theory are used to solve the huge set of linear algebraic equations in the process of integrating the equations of motion by using the generalized-a method, and an OpenMP based parallel scheme is also introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through two numerical examples.

Due to the high dynamic range (HDR) nature of headlight beam-pattern data, which is projected onto the virtual road, high dynamic range illumination models are required. These are used as the basis for illumination in simulations for automotive headlight virtual prototyping. Since high dynamic range illumination models operate on brightness ranges commensurate with the real world, a postprocessing operation, known as tone mapping, is required to map each frame into the device-specific range of the display hardware. Algorithms for tone mapping, called tone-mapping operators, can be classified as global or local. Global operators are efficient to compute at the expense of scene quality. Local operators preserve scene detail, but, due to their additional computational complexity, are rarely used with interactive applications. Local tone-mapping methods produce more usable visualization results for engineering tasks. This paper proposes a local tone-mapping method suitable for use with interactive applications. To develop a suitable tone-mapping operator, a state of the art local tone-mapping method was accelerated using modern, work-efficient GPU (graphics processing unit) algorithms. Optimal performance, both in terms of memory and speed, was achieved by means of general-purpose GPU programming with CUDA (compute unified device architecture). A prototypic implementation has shown that the method works well with high dynamic range OpenGL applications.

Nonlinear shallow water equations are often used to model the tsunami propagation. Tsunami inundation is modeled by adding the friction slope to the conservation of momentum. The two-step second-order finite difference MacCormack numerical method can solve these equations. It is well suited for nonlinear equations and simpler for related application development. In addition, the finite difference method can be computed in parallel. The programmable graphics hardware allows general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPUs) to solve the MacCormack method in parallel to speed up the simulation. Tsunami simulation data can be loaded as textures data in graphics memory, the computation processes can be written as shader programs using OpenGL Shading Language so that the operations can be computed by graphics processors in parallel. We developed different versions of the tsunami simulation and visualization programs: (i) CPU-based, and (ii) CPU-GPU collaboration to implement the MacCormack numerical method. The performance results showed that graphics hardware accelerated simulation had a significant improvement in the execution time of each computation step. Real-time simulation and visualization are made possible by the programmable shaders.

While the focus at present is on smartphone-based services for monitoring and controlling the state of individual devices, the spread of advanced services for simultaneously controlling a variety of devices is anticipated. However, the control procedures and functions of network-ready devices differ signifi cantly between vendors and even between models. Moreover, they are frequently upgraded. As a result, the development of services that use various types of devices is hampered. A service platform that can conceal such differences among individual devices is thus becoming increasingly important. We have developed a service platform that models any device as a virtual device having common properties for that device type and that provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for controlling these virtual devices. These APIs enable a service developer to control an actual device by controlling its virtual device, which negates the need for detailed knowledge of individual devices and promotes effi cient development of services.

These minimum weight approaches offer some advantages and avoid unwanted phenomena associated to maximum stiffness approaches, e.g. mesh dependency, checkerboard layouts. In addition, minimum weight formulations analyze more usual statements from a practical point of view in engineering since they reduce the cost of the structure and impose stress constraints. The minimum weight formulation with stress constraints proposed in this paper guarantees the feasibility of the optimal solutions obtained while the cost is minimized. However, these formulations also require bigger computing effort than the traditional maximum stiffness statements since the number of highly non-linear stress constraints is drastically increased while the number of design variables is analogous. Thus, it is necessary to introduce numerical methods and computational techniques that allow to reduce the resources required. In this paper, we propose the use of parallelization techniques in order to reduce the computing time required to solve the topology optimization problem with stress constraints proposed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The parallelization is classically based on a bidimensional domain decomposition, but has been specifically developed for a solenoidal Fourier-Chebyshev spectral approximation where in one Fourier direction, the number of modes is very large compared with the two other directions. The approach therefore differs from classical libraries developed for cubic Fourier boxes. The strategy uses message-passing interface (MPI) for message-passing among nodes and is fairly portable. One of the originalities of this paper is the use of an efficient hybrid programming with MPI for internodes communications and a coarse grain parallelism using OpenMP for core shared-memory computation, instead of the classical hybrid programming with MPI and a fine granularity parallelism at the loop level with OpenMP directives. This hybrid parallelism has been tested on the recent generation of high-performance parallel supercomputers involving a few tens of cores per node. Performances are evaluated on different low-frequency and high-frequency processors massively parallel platforms. We demonstrate that spectral methods, which are known to be inherently ill-fitted for the new generation of high-performance distributed-memory computers, can be implemented efficiently using this hybrid programming with good scalability and a very fast wall-clock time per iteration. New numerical experiments are therefore now accessible on petascale computers, while keeping the attractive features of spectral methods such as accuracy, exponential convergence, computational efficiency and conservative properties. This is illustrated by a direct numerical simulation of the transition of the boundary layers developing from the entrance section of a plane channel and interacting to merge into a fully turbulent flow. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Direct numerical simulation; Domain decomposition methods; Fourier series; Iterative methods; Message passing; Parallel programming; Spectroscopy; Supercomputers; Turbulent flow; High-order methods; Hybrid parallel programming; Peta-scale computing; Spectral methods; Transition; Convergence of numerical methods","High-order methods; Hybrid parallel programming strategy; Petascale computing; Spectral method; Transition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878628513"

Easy access to federated activity streams of colleagues and other awareness information that is aggregated from different distributed intra- and extra-organizational systems become more and more important for the daily knowledge work. The increasing number of platforms every person uses requires a flexible data integration solution that keeps track of the connections between the pieces of information and the persons involved in their creation in order to create a unified and aggregated view for work groups, teams and communities. This unified data collection is especially important for social network analysis and data mining as individual profiles and activities are meanwhile typically distributed over various source systems.

In this paper, experimental data of the following type were collected for structural identification (St-Id) of a deteriorated bridge: (1) static displacement and strain measurements taken under proof-load level and (2) multireference impact testing (MRIT) data from one of the spans of a three-span, cast-in-place reinforced concrete T-beam bridge (Smithers Bridge). The MRIT was used to generate the modal data for computation of the modal flexibility and displacement profiles. Several significant obstacles were encountered during the St-Id of the Smithers Bridge including high damping level (which led to difficulties in identifying and selecting the poles), finite-element (FE) model updating challenges, and correlation of the MRIT results with truck load test measurements. The first challenge was addressed through the use of the complex mode indicator function method of modal identification, which is capable of identifying highly damped modes. Then the updating of the FE model was accomplished using the Strand7 FE analysis package coupled with the MATLAB application programming interface. Finally, to allow for direct comparison of the MRIT and truck load results, two strategies were employed. The first involved the redistribution of truck load force to the MRIT degrees of freedom and the second utilized interpolation functions for modal expansion of the MRIT results to include the truck tire locations. The St-Id procedure used during this application was designed to mitigate blatant human error and epistemic uncertainty in the data interpretation process. Successful results from the MRIT demonstrated the reliability of the applications for bridge condition assessment based on impact testing. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bridges; Concretes; Data processing; Finite element method; Impact testing; Load testing; MIMO systems; Modal analysis; Reinforced concrete; Strain measurement; Trucks; Uncertainty analysis; Condition assessments; Experimental modal analysis; Load ratings; Model updating; Multi reference; Structural identification; Truck load; Structural analysis","Bridge condition assessment; Experimental modal analysis; Load rating; Model updating; Multiple-input multiple-output testing; Multireference impact testing (MRIT); Structural identification (St-Id); Truck load testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873911755"

Work stealing is an effective load balancing strategy for parallel computing. In this paper, we present dynamic work stealing strategies in a lazy-task creation technique for efficient fine-grain task scheduling. The basic idea is to control load balancing granularity depending on the number of task parents in a stack. The dynamic-length strategy of work stealing uses run-time information, which is information on the load of the victim, to determine the number of tasks that a thief is allowed to steal. We compare it with the bottommost first work stealing strategy used in StackThread/MP, and the fixed-length strategy of work stealing, where a thief requests to steal a fixed number of tasks, as well as other multithreaded frameworks such as Cilk and OpenMP task implementations. The experiments show that the dynamic-length strategy of work stealing performs well in irregular workloads such as in UTS benchmarks, as well as in regular workloads such as Fibonacci, Strassen's matrix multiplication, FFT, and Sparse-LU factorization. The dynamic-length strategy works better than the fixed-length strategy because it is more flexible than the latter; this strategy can avoid load imbalance due to overstealing. © 2012 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Lazy task creation; Load balancing strategy; Load imbalance; MAtrix multiplication; Multiple steals; Overhead reductions; Run-time information; Steal overhead; Multitasking","Frame management; Load imbalance; Multiple steals; Overhead reduction; Steal overhead","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861885912"

The multi-color ordering method is required to avoid the data race condition in do-loop parallelization and to achieve the uniqueness of a solution of GS. A coloring algorithm of painting neighbor cells with different colors is proposed for the multi-color ordering method. The method is tested for four sample simulation cases: one case of two-dimensional simulation and three cases of three-dimensional simulation. Through the sample simulations, the uniqueness of the solution of the Multi-Color ordering Gauss Seidel (MCGS) method is verified, and the convergence ratio of MCGS is found to be in the similar level to that of GS and better than the Jacobi method. The parallel efficiency is examined for workstations with two hexa-core CPUs or two octa-core CPUs.

For the best case, a 90.4% increase in light extraction was measured without optical coupling, which compares to photonic crystal techniques.

Such applications are threatened by attackers that often attempts to inject directly, or by leveraging a stepstone website, script codes that perform malicious operations. Web scripting based malware proliferation is being more and more industrialized with the drawbacks and advantages that characterize such approach: on one hand, we are witnessing a lot of samples that exhibit the same characteristics which make these easy to detect, while on the other hand, professional developers are continuously developing new attack techniques. While obfuscation is still a debated issue within the community, it becomes clear that, with new schemes being designed, this issue cannot be ignored anymore. Because many proposed countermeasures confess that they perform better on unobfuscated contents, we propose a 2-stage technique that first relieve the burden of obfuscation by emulating the deobfuscation stage before performing a static abstraction of the analyzed sample's functionalities in order to reveal its intent. We support our proposal with evidence from applying our technique to real-life examples and provide discussion on performance in terms of time, as well as possible other applications of proposed techniques in the areas of web crawling and script classification. Additionally, we claim that such approach can be generalized to other scripting languages similar to JavaScript.

Frequently, the calibration task is divided into two steps: camera calibration followed by projector calibration. The latter still poses certain problems that are not easy to solve, such as the difficulty in obtaining a set of 2D-3D points to compute the projection matrix between the projector and the world. Existing methods are either not sufficiently accurate or not flexible. We propose an easy and automatic method to calibrate such systems that consists in projecting a calibration pattern and superimposing it automatically on a known printed pattern. The projected pattern is provided by a virtual camera observing a virtual pattern in an OpenGL model. The projector displays what the virtual camera visualizes. Thus, the projected pattern can be controlled and superimposed on the printed one with the aid of visual servoing. Our experimental results compare favorably with those of other methods considering both usability and accuracy. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Application programming interfaces (API); Augmented reality; Cameras; Three dimensional; Visual servoing; Accurate measurement; Calibration patterns; Calibration tasks; Camera calibration; Projected patterns; Projector calibration; Projector-camera system; Structured light systems; Calibration","OpenGL modeling; Projector calibration; Structured light system; Visual servoing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84885156231"

The solution procedure requires a multiple-level-deep nested iteration, which involves extended solution time and convergence difficulty. In this study, a simple air foil bearing model is used and the compressible-fluid Reynolds equation for modeling gas lubrication is linearized by Newton's method. The discretized equation is solved by one of the two parallel iterative methods, red-black or strip partition successive-over-relaxation (SOR) method. The parallel programming is conducted using OpenMP programming in an eight-core work-station. Then, a numerical damping scheme for the film-profile convergence is presented. Finally, a root-finding process is conducted to iteratively attain the eccentricity of the bearing for a given load. It is found that the numerical damping step is crucial, which allows the use of a larger relaxation factor to have a fast rate of convergence. Both the parallel SOR methods are easy to implement and the red-black SOR method exhibits better efficiency in the studied cases.

It can secretly record video information from the built-in camera for the third party, greatly compromising the privacy of smartphone users. Based on the Windows Mobile 5.0/6.0 platform, SVC employs the relevant application programming interfaces (APIs) to control the hardware, such as camera, system monitor, and wireless connection. In the application layer, SVC is composed of three parts, namely, video capture, triggering algorithm, and file sending. The file-sending module sends the video data to remote SVC intenders by practical methods such as e-mail and a multimedia messaging service (MMS). The triggering algorithm is the control module that determines the right time to turn on the video-capture process or send the video information. The process of embedding an SVC in a 3G smartphone is called an infection process. There are three ways for SVC to infect a smartphone, through a Trojan horse, a worm, or a virus.","Application programming interfaces (API); Cameras; Computer systems programming; Signal encoding; Viruses; Application layers; Control module; Infection process; Multimedia messaging service; Practical method; Smart phones; Spy-ware; System monitors; Third parties; Trojan horse; Video capture; Video data; Video information; Windows Mobile 5.0; Wireless connection; Algorithms","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-82155163728"

Refactoring activities are often motivated by the detection of bad smells. With the increasing adoption of Design-by-Contract (DBC) methodologies in formal software development, evidence of bad design practices can similarly be found in programs that combine actual production code with interface contracts. These contracts can be written in languages, such as the Java Modeling Language (JML), an extension to the Java syntax. This paper presents a catalog of bad smells that appear during DBC practice, considering JML as the language for specifying contracts. These smells are described over JML constructs, although several can appear in other DBC languages. The catalog contains 6 DBC smells. We evaluate the recurrence of DBC smells in two ways: first by describing a small study with graduate student projects, and second by counting occurrences of smells in contracts from the JML models application programming interface (API). This API contains classes with more than 1,600 lines in contracts. Along with the documented smells, suggestions are provided for minimizing the impact or even removing a bad smell. It is believed that initiatives towards the cataloging of bad smells are useful for establishing good design practices in DBC. © 2013.

The developed implementation simultaneously utilizes computational power of the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU) to the computational tasks best suited to each architecture. Recently, closed-form expression for this discrete Green's function (DGF) was derived, which facilitates its applications in the FDTD simulations of radiation and scattering problems. Unfortunately, implementation of the new DGF formula in software requires a multiple precision arithmetic and may cause long runtimes. Therefore, an acceleration of the DGF computations on a CPU-GPU heterogeneous parallel processing system was developed using the multiple precision arithmetic and the OpenMP and CUDA parallel programming interfaces. The method avoids drawbacks of the CPU- and GPU-only accelerated implementations of the DGF, i.e. long runtime on the CPU and significant overhead of the GPU initialization respectively for long and short lengths of the DGF waveform.

At first sight, the conclusion is that only massive parallelism at the loop or domain decomposition level will lead to higher FLOP counts. However, the significant differences in advances for CPUs/GPUs versus RAM and interprocessor communication bandwidth lead to a so-called 'limiting domain size', below which communication dominates execution times and performance degrades drastically. The consequences of this 'red-shift' for the future of CFD are manifold: the time to advance the solution one timestep is limited, implying that even with unlimited number of processors/cores, LES, DES and DNS runs for realistic Reynolds-numbers will require days or weeks of execution. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Communication; Computational fluid dynamics; Domain decomposition methods; Program processors; Domain size; GPUs; Inter processor communication; Massive parallelism; MPI; OpenMP; Significant differences; Time step; Telecommunication systems","CFD; GPUs; Massive parallelism; MPI; OpenMP","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881555658"

A frequently encountered transportation problem is the ""shortest path problem;"" that is, finding the shortest path between any two nodes in a transportation network. For the large transportation networks encountered in major metropolitan areas, this problem can be computationally demanding, especially if shortest paths between all the nodes in the network need to be dynamically updated (e.g., evolving traffic conditions). In such a situation, one may wish to harness parallel computing to solve this problem. However, the parallel implementations of commonly used shortest-path algorithms are computationally demanding because of the inherent sequential nature of the search process used by the algorithms. This paper describes parallel implementations and includes performance analyses of two prominent graph algorithms (i.e., Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra) used for finding the all-pairs shortest path for a large-scale transportation network. The results indicate that a multilevel parallel implementation that combines message passing interface (MPI) with shared memory threads [e.g., Open Multiprocessing (OpenMP) or POSIX Threads (pthreads)] is effective for solving these problems on a moderate number of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) nodes. This paper also includes the derivation of the computational time for the different parallel implementations of these two graph algorithms. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Graph theory; Multiprocessing systems; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Transportation; All-pairs shortest paths; Computing; Graph algorithms; Large-scale transportation; Message passing interface; Parallel implementations; Shortest path algorithms; Symmetric multi-processors; Problem solving","Computing; Graph algorithm; Parallel computing; Transportation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876141249"

While end users are deriving great value from the content and applications accessible over the Internet, network providers and their equipment vendors are still largely relegated to the role of bit pipe providers. Furthermore, the network provider revenues associated with these bit pipes are not commensurate with the network infrastructure costs to support the tremendous traffic demands of the above applications. This broken business model threatens to derail the tremendous growth and innovation that the Internet has fostered. Application Enablement is an industry vision to help network providers better monetize their network assets and capabilities and at the same time provide a superior experience to end users by combining the best of the application and network capabilities. This paper addresses both technical and business aspects of opening up network quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth control capabilities to application content providers (ACPs) and end users. Our vision is to enable network providers to provide a smart network pipe that can be personalized on a dynamic, real-time basis to match the particular needs of the application and end users. The paper discusses several use cases and an associated network architecture for implementing them. We propose simple Web-style application programming interfaces (APIs) to expose network QoS and bandwidth information to application providers and content providers.

I prefer to cycle'the Tube is crowded and prone to delays'but there are times when it's too cold or wet to avoid the train. Last year, I realized that making the decision before my daily commute to cycle or take the Tube had become a surprisingly complex affair. Transport for London, which runs the city's transit network, opened up its application programming interfaces (APIs) in 2010 to developers as part of the London Datastore, which aggregates data from a number of public sector organizations serving the city (http://data.london.gov.uk). This led to the creation of dozens of status and travel planning apps for commuters. Consequently, I'd check the weather forecast the evening before and the status of the Tube on my phone in the morning. I'd hooked up an instant messenger alert (via the IFTTT.com service) for rain. None of this was particularly draining, but it was an extra bunch of things that made Monday mornings a bit more Monday morning-ey. I wanted something that would handle all that data and help me spend less time choosing and more time drinking my tea. So I created the Bicycle Barometer, with a needle that swings between a bicycle and a Tube icon depending on the conditions © 2013 IEEE.","Barometers; Bicycles; Tubes (components); Weather forecasting; Instant messengers; ITS applications; Public sector organization; Transit networks; Transport for london; Travel planning; Weather forecasts; Application programming interfaces (API)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878718341"

The methods analyzed are: (A) a task decomposition on the discrete directions and frequencies with two numeric strategies: Message Passing Interface (MPI) with distributed memory and OpenMP with shared memory for the direction decomposition; (B) a new algorithm for a DOM subdomain decomposition, which is proposed and tested using MPI; and (C) hybrid methods combining an OpenMP strategy for direction and MPI for tasks and subdomain decomposition. It is shown for the case of coupled simulations that the convergence and the parallel efficiency of the domain decomposition (B) are optimal. This method is limited in this work to 25 sub-domains, at which point the efficiency stagnates. Combining the directions with frequency and/or domain decompositions in a hybrid method (C) results in very good efficiency up to 1,200 processors. This hybrid strategy is also very efficient in terms of memory usage.

New technologies that provide information about various modes and environments can help to inform choices regarding travel and accessibility. In this paper we describe the development of a web-based accessibility calculator prototype for the Greater Montreal Area in Canada. The core of this tool is a statistical model of trip length developed using the spatial expansion method. The model is used to obtain estimates of trip length for a desired profile, based on attributes such as age, gender, family structure, and mode of travel, as well as geographical location. These estimates are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities accessibility measure to different types of essential destinations. Travel behavior information is drawn from Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys. Geocoded information about trip origins and destinations is used to calculate trip length. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes, and urban form are used. A geocoded business point database is used for the calculation of cumulative opportunities. To simplify the use of the accessibility calculator, the model is implemented in a user-friendly way using Google Maps API v3 and a convenient interface. Different possible uses of the accessibility calculator are illustrated in the paper.

The combination of these capabilities enables the production of good quality complex parts from practically any material at a very fast pace. As for rapid prototypes fabricated by the FDFF process, it is certainly possible to employ adaptive slicing technique due to the possibility of cutting different metal/non-metal sheet at various thicknesses. This paper proposes a new adaptive slicing method whereby the capability of cutting a 3D solid model at the predefined sheets' thicknesses is achieved and the geometry of all internal and external features of a part is also investigated to ensure the reduction of part geometry deviation through the seamless curvature detection. Despite most previous works which start slicing a tessellated or direct CAD model at the maximum available thickness, this system commences the process with available minimum thickness by applying a new adaptive method to all pairs of contours at the top and bottom slices of the layer. Autodesk Inventor solid modeler, as a design-by-feature solid modeler, is used for 3D solid modeling. The proposed system is implemented by Visual Basic codes inside Inventor using API functions to access both geometry and topology information of the design-by-feature solid model.

With the measured magnetic flux intensities at two points around the rectangular magnet by 3-axis magnetic sensors, a non-linear equation group is established, and the location and orientation of the rectangular magnet can be determined by seeking the solution of the equation group by using general Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm. However, the time occupied by general L-M algorithm is too long to realize real-time tracking for the rectangular magnet. We propose an improved method which computes Jacobin Matrix in L-M algorithm in parallel. Making use of the Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) model, the parallel operation is implemented on the dual-core personal computer.

Purchasing a UI tool gives one instant access to the many of the man years invested in development. A third party solution is more mature and field tested. Further, with increased complexity of the hardware, it just makes more sense for one to concentrate on adding value by focusing on the latest and greatest UI. There are devices now that are more compact and more powerful than ever. Many of these new devices have hardware graphics accelerators conforming to the OpenGL ES specification. OpenGL ES helps offload much of the graphics processing from the main CPU to the GPU. Somewhat surprisingly, many of the UI solutions built today are designed not to use the GPU, instead they thrash the CPU while the GPU sits idle wasting valuable silicon.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer graphics; User interfaces; Consumer expectations; Graphics accelerators; Graphics processing; New devices; Software developer; Third parties; Computer graphics equipment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84255200541"

In particular, the need for low-power designs and power-aware system management is getting stronger. While multicore systems are deployed in many embedded system areas, an effective power management technique for multicores is not available yet. In this paper, we propose a novel power management technique based on a parallel programming model. OpenMP is a well-known programming paradigm for shared memory multicore systems. OpenMP is based on library routines for parallel processing. By identifying the invoked library routines, how many cores will be adequate for a certain application can be determined, and the number of necessary cores for a given task can be determined during run-time. By turning off unnecessary cores, we can reduce power consumption. We implemented this method by adding capabilities in an OpenMP-compliant compiler and conducted experiments with various benchmarks. We were able to reduce the power consumption by 18% on average compared to other conventional power management methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Data processing; Embedded systems; Energy management; Industrial management; Intelligent systems; Mobile devices; Ubiquitous computing; Dynamic power management; Low-power design; Multi core; Open multiprocessings; Parallel programming model; Power management techniques; Programming paradigms; Ubiquitous computing environment; Application programming interfaces (API)","Dynamic power management; low-power design; multicore; open multiprocessing (OpenMP)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84882988662"

Clara, CA, USA). The FMM is a class of methods to compute pairwise interactions between N particles for a given error tolerance and with computational cost of O(N). The methods described in the paper are applicable to any FMMs in which the multipole-to-local (M2L) operator is a dense matrix and the matrix is precomputed. This is the case for example in the black-box fast multipole method (bbFMM), which is a variant of the FMM that can handle large class of kernels. This example will be used in our benchmarks. In the FMM, two operators represent most of the computational cost, and an optimal implementation typically tries to balance those two operators. One is the nearby interaction calculation (direct sum calculation, line 29 in Listing1), and the other is the M2L operation. We focus on the M2L. By combining multiple M2L operations and reordering the primitive loops of the M2L so that CUDA threads can reuse or share common data, these approaches reduce the movement of data in the GPU. Because memory bandwidth is the primary bottleneck of these methods, significant performance improvements are realized. Four M2L schemes are detailed and analyzed in the case of a uniform tree. The four schemes are tested and compared with an optimized, OpenMP parallelized, multi-core CPU code. We consider high and low precision calculations by varying the number of Chebyshev nodes used in the bbFMM. The accuracy of the GPU codes is found to be satisfactory and achieved performance over 200Gflop/s on one NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU (Nvidia Corporation, Sta. Clara, CA, USA). This was compared against two quad-core Intel Xeon E5345 processors (Intel Corporation, Sta. Clara, CA, USA) running at 2.33GHz, for a combined peak performance of 149Gflop/s for single precision. For the low FMM accuracy case, the observed performance of the CPU code was 37Gflop/s, whereas for the high FMM accuracy case, the performance was about 8.5Gflop/s, most likely because of a higher frequency of cache misses. We also present benchmarks on an NVIDIA C2050 GPU (a Fermi processor)(Nvidia Corporation, Sta.

Many frameworks and libraries have been proposed or commercialized to simplify the design and tuning of real-time image processing applications. However, they tend to lack flexibility, because they are normally oriented toward particular types of applications, or they impose specific data processing models such as the pipeline. Other issues include large memory footprints, difficulty for reuse, and inefficient execution on multicore processors. We present a novel software architecture for time-constrained machine vision applications that addresses these issues. The architecture is divided into three layers. The platform abstraction layer provides a high-level application programming interface for the rest of the architecture. The messaging layer provides a message-passing interface based on a dynamic publish/subscribe pattern. A topic-based filtering in which messages are published to topics is used to route the messages from the publishers to the subscribers interested in a particular type of message. The application layer provides a repository for reusable application modules designed for machine vision applications. These modules, which include acquisition, visualization, communication, user interface, and data processing, take advantage of the power of well-known libraries such as OpenCV, Intel IPP, or CUDA. Finally, the proposed architecture is applied to a real machine vision application: a jam detector for steel pickling lines. © 2013 The Authors.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer software reusability; Data processing; Descaling; Libraries; Message passing; Multicore programming; Software architecture; User interfaces; Video signal processing; Data processing models; Design and implementations; High level applications; Message passing interface; Multi-core processor; Platform abstraction layers; Proposed architectures; Real-time image processing; Computer vision","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879987656"

On the basis of this infrastructure for providing transit data over the Internet, the authors developed an algorithm to calculate the travel times of K shortest paths in a public transportation network where all wait and travel times were known only in real time. Although there was a large body of work on routing algorithms in transit networks, the authors took cues from an algorithm to find the shortest paths in road networks, called transit node routing. This approach was based on observation of intuitive behavior by humans: when taking transit, travelers looked for a particular set of transfer points that connected transit routes that led from the origin and destination. A lookup table was precomputed of feasible paths between the origin stop of every bus route to the terminus of every other bus route by using the transfer points. This precomputation of paths significantly reduced the computation time and number of real-time arrival requests to transit agency servers, the bottleneck in computing this problem. The computational complexity of the algorithm is linear in real time, and implementation results show that queries from a web server are returned in 3 s in the worst case.","Application programming interfaces (API); Bus transportation; Buses; Graph theory; Mass transportation; Table lookup; Transportation routes; Travel time; Urban transportation; Computation time; K shortest path; Online application programming; Origin and destinations; Public transit networks; Public transportation networks; Transit agencies; Transit networks; Computational complexity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857008884"

In an earlier article, a proof-of-concept for a computer-aided visualization tool (also named STEVE, version 1.0) for stochastic theory education in water resources engineering was articulated [see, Schwenk et al. Comput. Appl. Eng. Educ., 2008, in press). Using Java Native Interfacing, it was shown that STEVE 1.0 could wrap a space-time stochastic model written in any computer language and be independent of any specific language compiler during tool usage. This article describes the general philosophy, software design, and classroom usage for STEVE with significant improvements on visualization and user-friendliness (hence, rightfully called version 2.0). The software was created using the C++ programming language with the Microsoft Windows Applications Programming Interface (API). OpenGL was used for the visualization display, and the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) was used to visualize text inside the OpenGL window. The instructor-specified simulation program on stochastic theory was written in Fortran 77. The application has user-friendly options for modifying input data and parameter specifications as desired by the instructor or the student user. STEVE 2.0 has been tested with the Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems.

Unfortunately, direct simulations with the available computational resources are limited to relatively low-Reynolds numbers because of the almost numberless small scales produced by the non-linear convective term. Alternatively, we consider regularizations of the convective term that preserve the symmetry and conservation properties exactly. This yields to a class of regularizations [Verstappen R. On restraining the production of small scales of motion in a turbulent channel flow. Comput Fluids 2008:37;887-97] that restrain the production of small scales of motion in an unconditionally stable manner. In this way, the new set of equations is dynamically less complex than the original Navier-Stokes equations, and therefore more amenable to be numerically solved. It relies on a self-adjoint linear filter whose local filter length is determined from the requirement that vortex-stretching must be stopped at the scale set by the grid [Trias FX, Verstappen RWCP, Gorobets A, Soria M, Oliva A. Parameter-free symmetry-preserving regularization modeling of a turbulent differentially heated cavity. Comput Fluids 2010:39;1815-31].

DENSO mass-produced the world's first reconfigurable instrument cluster in 2008. To satisfy customer requirements, large quantities of resources were required. Coupled with an iterative process due to requirement changes, development costs became very high. Reducing development costs was vital in order to expand the reconfigurable instrument cluster products line. One solution was to use existing human machine interface (HMI) tools. However, most HMI tools are geared toward software developers and not graphic artists. Furthermore, each tool has its own unique method for image and scene creation, creating an ineffective and sometimes difficult environment for artists familiar with industry-leading computer graphics (CG) software to learn and use the tools. As a result, the artist-to-target workflow suffered from inefficiencies because software developers had to remodel the artists designs created with the CG software. Each time the design was changed, both artists and developers had to reiterate the development process. The instrument cluster is not only a primary source of information to the driver, but also connects the driver to the rest of the vehicle, establishing a somewhat personal relationship between human and machine. It is imperative that the instrument cluster design reflect clarity, precision and beauty. An artist-centric approach was proposed to reduce the development effort by introducing a data converter and real-time 3D rendering engine. The goal was to achieve minimal loss in the development cycle, from concept to production. The artist's idea, as expressed with industry-leading CG software (AutodeskŴ 3ds MaxŴ), must be precisely replicated at the target level. The new proposed workflow was as followed: First, an artist created a 3D model and scene in 3D CG software. Next, the 3D model and scene were exported and converted for use in the rendering engine. The converted data included parameters and shader code for the rendering engine. Finally, the data was ran on the rendering engine. The rendering engine called the appropriate OpenGL ES commands based on the converted data from the artist and dynamic input data from the developer's application code. With the new workflow, any changes the artist makes are immediately and seamlessly applied to the target. It is important that the rendering engine interprets the converted data on the embedded platform as close as possible to the artist's intended design. Using automatic shader code generation and frame rate improvement techniques contributed to rendering a high quality image on a TFT-LCD screen. The data converter was able to generate and optimize the shader code automatically based on parameters set by the artist in the 3D CG software. The new workflow was evaluated during a mass production development project and resulted in improved software development efficiency. While DENSO has succeeded in automating graphics development with data conversion and a rendering engine, the next goal is to integrate a model-based development tool to improve development efficiency. © 2013 SAE International.","3D modeling; Application programming interfaces (API); Automatic programming; Codes (symbols); Customer satisfaction; Data handling; Efficiency; Engines; Image enhancement; Iterative methods; Liquid crystal displays; Rendering (computer graphics); Thin film transistors; Three dimensional computer graphics; Automotive interiors; Customer requirements; Development process; High quality images; Human Machine Interface; Improvement technique; Model based development; Personal relationships; Software design","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878791067"

The procedure involves the parallel solution of local boundary value problems using boundary conditions from a coarse global problem. The local solutions are in turn used to enrich the global solution space using the partition of unity methodology. The parallel computation of local solutions can be implemented using a single pair of scatter-gather communications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the high parallel efficiency of these computations. For problems requiring non-uniform mesh refinement and enrichment, load unbalance is addressed by defining a larger number of small local problems than the number of parallel processors and by sorting and solving the local problems based on estimates of their workload. A simple and effective estimate of the largest number of processors where load balance among processors is maintained is also proposed.

However, most of them are based on standard PCs, which introduce performance limitations and excessive power consumption. To address these drawbacks, we explore the implementation prospectives of two Immersive-Audio technologies: the beamforming (BF) and the wave field synthesis (WFS). We target two popular multi-core platforms, namely graphic processor units (GPUs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We identify the most computationally intensive parts of both applications and employ the CUDA environment to map them onto a Quadro FX1700, a GeForce 8600GT, a GTX275, and a GTX460 GPU. Furthermore, we design our custom multi-core hardware accelerators for both algorithms and map them onto Virtex6 FPGAs. Both GPU and FPGA implementations are compared against OpenMP-annotated software running on a Core2 Duo at 3.0 GHz. Experimental results suggest that middle-range GPUs process data equally well as the Core2 Duo for the BF, and approximately two times faster for the WFS. However, high-end GPU and FPGA solutions provide an order of magnitude better performance for BF, and approximately two orders of magnitude better performance for WFS than the Core2 Duo. Ultimately, single-chip GPU and FPGA implementations can provide more power-effective solutions, since they can drive more complex microphone and loudspeaker setups than PC-based approaches. © 2011 IEEE.","Application programming interfaces (API); Audio systems; Beamforming; Computer architecture; Digital signal processors; Electroacoustic transducers; Microcomputers; Program processors; Signal processing; Speed control; Effective solution; FPGA implementations; Graphic processor units; Hardware accelerators; Immersive; Multi core; Multi-core platforms; Order of magnitude; Orders of magnitude; PC-based; Performance limitations; Power Consumption; Process data; Prospectives; reconfigurable architectures; Single-chip; Wave field synthesis; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","Audio systems; digital signal processors; reconfigurable architectures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952922270"

Hence, there is a need to provide an assessment of CIC and evaluate the line integrity, as well as identify the requirements for defect repair or line hydrotest. An experimental investigation was undertaken to evaluate the collapse pressures of lines containing corrosion, cracks, or (CIC) defects in a typical line pipe (API 5L Grade X52, 508 mm diameter, 5.7 mm wall thickness). The mechanical properties of the pipe were measured using tensile, Charpy, and J-testing for use in applying evaluation criteria. Rupture tests were undertaken on end-capped sections containing uniform depth, finite length corrosion, cracks, or CIC defects. Failure occurred by plastic collapse and ductile tearing for the corrosion defects, cracks, and CIC geometries tested. For the corrosion defects, the corroded pipe strength (CPS) method provided the most accurate results (13% conservative on average). The API 579 (level 3 failure assessment diagram (FAD), method D) provided the least conservative collapse pressure predictions for the cracks with an average error of 20%. The CIC collapse pressures were bounded by those of a long corrosion groove (upper bound) and a long crack (lower bound), with collapse dominated by the crack when the crack depth was significant. Application of API 579 to the CIC provided collapse pressure predictions that were 18% conservative. Sixteen rupture tests were successfully completed investigating the failure behavior of longitudinally oriented corrosion, crack, and CIC. The pipe material was characterized and these properties were used to predict the collapse pressure of the defects using current methods. Existing methods for corrosion (CPS) and cracks (API 579, level 3, method D) gave conservative collapse pressure predictions. The collapse pressures for the CIC were bounded by those of a long corrosion groove and a long crack, with collapse dominated by the crack when the crack depth was significant. CIC failure behavior was determined by the crack to corrosion depth ratio, total defect depth and its profile. The results showed that the failure pressures for CIC were reduced when their equivalent depths were similar to those of corrosion and using crack evaluation techniques provided an approximate collapse pressure. © 2013 by ASME.","Application programming interfaces (API); Corrosion rate; Crack propagation; Forecasting; Mechanical properties; Tensile testing; Water pipelines; Collapse pressure; Corrosion defect; Evaluation criteria; Experimental investigations; Failure assessment diagram; Failure behaviors; Plastic collapse; Transmission pipelines; Cracks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84889044746"

While providing unprecedented capabilities to conduct computational experiments of historic significance, these systems are presently difficult to program. The users, who are domain experts rather than computer experts, prefer to use programming models closer to their domains (e.g., physics and biology) rather than MPI and OpenMP. This has led the development of domain-specific programming that provides domain-specific programming interfaces but abstracts away some performance-critical architecture details. Based on experience in designing large-scale computing systems, a hybrid programming framework for scientific computing on heterogeneous architectures is proposed in this work. Its design philosophy is to provide a collaborative mechanism for domain experts and computer experts so that both domain-specific knowledge and performance-critical architecture details can be adequately exploited. Two real-world scientific applications have been evaluated on TH-1A, a peta-scale CPU-GPU heterogeneous system that is currently the 5th fastest supercomputer in the world.

By adopting the dual-scanline technique, which involves using two scanlines to concurrently sweep an input polygon, the parallel partitioning algorithm can process vertices and edges of the input polygon efficiently. The parallel polygon partitioning algorithm has been implemented in C++ with the use of OpenMP.

Along with new equipment and modern electronics, there are new opportunities in the automation control. This paper presents a hand motion controller, which measures the orientation of the upper limb of a man in three dimensional space. The design assumes the use of microcontrollers from Texas Instruments, which will be responsible for communication between specific modules. It assumed the usage of two types of communication UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) and I2C (called Inter-Integrated Circuit). Microcontrollers will also be responsible for monitoring the voltage and simple calculations. The entire system has been sown in the glove acting module possible to connect to different devices, and communicating through the I2C bus with the master device. In order to visualize the controller a hand model was developed in an environment of OpenGL and 3ds Max. Subsequently, the control program which is responsible for calculating the rotation matrix, and the calculation (using data from the matrix) of degrees of freedom associated with the forearm and the arm, was implemented. This is a broader issue related to the large number of calculations which are not capable of microcontrollers (requires a large computational power), that was the reason which extorted the computer's calculations communicated with the controller wirelessly by Bluetooth. In order to present the results, a physical manipulator, which mimics the trajectory of hand movement, was connected to a personal computer.

With this increase in density data-gathering problems come. It would be useful if an IP-based host could collect information from multiple remote data-centric networks via transparent communication among sensor nodes and IP-based hosts, using a common application programming interface (API). Two APIs are presented for efficiently producing data in WSN and retrieving the data from an IP network.

The workstation used for computing consists of dual six-core central processing units (CPUs) and a 256-core graphics processing unit (GPU) dedicated for computing. To compare the computational performance, the Reynolds equations are solved by a parallel iterative method using multithreaded and GPU computing. Multithreaded computing is conducted by OpenMP directives and GPU computing is executed using either NVIDIA's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming or the accelerator programming model (APM). The lubrication models used are an inclined surface slider with or without a central recess and an air journal bearing. In GPU computing, both the CUDA and APM are subjected to communication latency to achieve efficient fine-grained computations. The results show that the performance of the less expensive GPU computing is close to that of multithreaded computing in which the grid sizes are large in the analyses. The performance of the OpenMP-like APM programming is compatible with CUDA computing in the slider cases but is significantly worse for air bearings.

For efficient Delaunay triangulation, points are first sorted into cells, each of which is allocated roughly equal number of points. The cells are naturally grouped into zones, in which Delaunay triangulation is constructed by simultaneous point insertion cell by cell within each zone. Tetrahedra at the boundary between zones are created in parallel by adding layers of cells at the boundary of each zone to ensure that circumspheres of boundary tetrahedra contain no points in their interior. Redundant tetrahedra at the boundary between zones can be easily eliminated by individual processors in a completely independent manner by means of the elegant minimum vertex allocation scheme, such that a simplex with k vertices from zones (z 1,z 2,...,z k) is allocated to zone z=min(z 1,z 2,...,z k).The parallel 3D Delaunay triangulation algorithm has been coded in Intel FORTRAN VS2010. The parallel zonal insertion on a PC can boost the speed of the single-processor insertion by 4.5 times for the insertion of 50 million randomly generated spatial points in 133. s. The scalability of the parallel zonal insertion algorithm has also been tested on a proper multi-core machine with 12 processors running on OpenMP parallel directives with shared memory. Provided the number of zones is an integral multiple of the number of processors used, almost 100% scalability at 90% efficiency was observed for parallel insertion using 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 processors, and a 10.8 time speed up was recorded in a parallel insertion of 20 million points in 2 × 2× 3 = 12 zones by 12 processors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Cells; Cytology; Geometry; Microprocessor chips; Scalability; Triangulation; Cells and zones; Delaunay triangulation; Insertion algorithms; Integral multiples; Multi-core machines; Parallel Delaunay triangulation; Point insertion; Shared memories; Spatial points; Three dimensions; Parallel processing systems","Parallel Delaunay triangulation; Partition into cells and zones; Point insertion; Three dimensions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861854652"

With increasing number of cores, however, it becomes even harder to efficiently schedule parallel applications on these resources since current many-core runtime systems still lack effective mechanisms to support collaborative scheduling of these applications. In this paper, we study feedback-driven adaptive scheduling based on work stealing, which provides an efficient solution for concurrently executing a set of applications on many-core systems. To dynamically estimate the number of cores desired by each application, a stable feedback-driven adaptive algorithm, called SAWS, is proposed using active workers and the length of active deques, which well captures the runtime characteristics of the applications. Furthermore, a prototype system is built by extending the Cilk runtime system, and the experimental results, which are obtained on a Sun Fire server, show that SAWS has more advantages for scheduling concurrent parallel applications. Specifically, compared with existing algorithms A-Steal and WS-EQUI, SAWS improves the performances by up to 12.43% and 21.32% with respect to mean response time respectively, and 25.78% and 46.98% with respect to processor utilization, respectively.

Several techniques to optimize the serial implementation of the DSMC method are first discussed. Specifically for a 3-level Cartesian grid, a Cartesian-based movement technique including particle indexing is demonstrated to result in a modest decrease in overall simulation expense of 34% compared with a ray-tracing technique combined with stored cell-connectivity. Two strategies for data localization leading to optimal usage of cache memory are demonstrated to speed up certain cell-based functions (such as collision computations) by a factor of 3.38-4.36. The shared-memory parallel implementation using OpenMP is then described in detail. Synchronization points and related critical sections are identified as major factors that impact the OpenMP parallel performance. Techniques to remove all such synchronization points in the OpenMP implementation of the DSMC method are outlined. For dual-core and quad-core systems, speedups of 1.99 and 3.74, respectively, are obtained for a (free-stream flow) test simulation with low granularity. Finally, the parallel performance of identical source code employing OpenMP is shown to be strongly correlated to the underlying computer architecture.

However, the current dominant approach to analysis and evaluation of design proposals requires the creation of a separate building model for each kind of evaluation. This typically involves using a BIM tool to prepare the data for a specific type of analysis to obtain design feedback. Most of the effort lies in modifying the building model to support the analysis required. When dealing with multiple evaluations, this process is time consuming, greatly reducing the design benefits of BIM. We propose a system architecture to facilitate analysis and feedback in architectural design, based on post-processing design-oriented building models. The post-processing automatically adapts the building model to the needs of the specific analysis, where multiple analyses can be run from the same building model. We outline the methods for realizing such design interoperability. By utilizing geometric and attribute relationships and semantics, data subsets are identified and aggregated. We present an example where the design of a class of buildings - federal courthouses, is evaluated in terms of multiple analyses: programmatic spaces, building circulation, energy consumption, and preliminary cost.

Nevertheless it is a promising way to significantly improve software quality by simplifying the development process. This paper describes a method for a declarative and fully automated creation of graphical user interfaces from Java objects, i.e. the information accessible via the Java Reflection API. For this purpose we created the Visual Reflection Library (VRL). VRL interfaces are able to represent complex workflows and allow for a certain degree of visual programming. We start by describing an application: the development of an interactive user interface for the simulation system UG. By shortly discussing the requirements for such an interface, we will explain the reasons for creating VRL and the benefits we gained from it. After that we give an overview of our methods and show several applications. We end by summarizing our results and giving a future outlook. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer software selection and evaluation; Graphical user interfaces; Software quality; Automated mapping; Complex workflows; Development process; Interactive user interfaces; Intuitive user interface; Java reflections; Simulation systems; Visual programming; Java programming language","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921375907"

The brownout phenomenon, caused by the rotor downwash on a dusty or sandy underground has caused several critical incidences and accidents in the past. In contrast to an extensive free wake analysis of the rotor vortices, this paper presents a computer graphical solution to simulate brownout conditions. The animation approach builds upon a particle system with a basic aerodynamic assumption of a permanent ground vortex and additional turbulence. The created brownout effect module is a part of the RealTime Image Generator software, used in DLR's ground based helicopter flight simulator. The object oriented structure of the underlying application programming interface OpenSceneGraph facilitates the development of a generic effect interface for future improvements. An overview of the developed module, the particle system engine and the physical dependencies is provided. To overcome the challenge of capturing the visual realism, a pilot test course with brownout typical tasks is presented. Criteria focussing on the visual and physical parameters are defined to build up a questionnaire.

Most traditional networks lack capabilities for accommodating user-centric service paradigm. Taking this into consideration, the proposed NKL has capabilities to acquire contextual information from various sources, to evolve this information with legacy information into high-level knowledge, and to expose the high-level knowledge to entities outside the network. For easy knowledge exposure, we specify a set of abstracted application programming interfaces (APIs). For efficient handling of network knowledge accessed by the APIs, we design and compare the three different network knowledge models. With the proposed APIs and the three knowledge models, we accomplish the experimental performance evaluation of NKL to verify its feasibility. The results of the various tests on knowledge models and APIs give good guidelines for efficient design and exposing network knowledge in developing a user-centric service platform.

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a well known topic model. Variational Bayesian inference or collapsed Gibbs sampling is often used to estimate parameters in LDA; however, these inference methods incur high computational cost for large-scale data. Therefore, highly efficient technology is needed for this purpose. We use parallel computation technology for efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling inference for LDA. We assume a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) cluster, which has been widely used in recent years. In prior work on parallel inference for LDA, either MPI or OpenMP has often been used alone. For an SMP cluster, however, it is more suitable to adopt hybrid parallelization that uses message passing for communication between SMP nodes and loop directives for parallelization within each SMP node. We developed an MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallel inference method for LDA, and evaluated the performance of the inference under various settings of an SMP cluster. We further investigated the approximation that controls the inter-node communications, and found out that it achieved noticeable increase in inference speed while maintaining inference accuracy.

While wireless telemetry has been previously proposed for structural monitoring, comparatively less research has focused on the creation of a complete and scalable data management system that manages the storage and interrogation of wireless sensor data. This paper reports on the development of a novel wireless structural monitoring system specifically tailored for large-scale civil infrastructure systems by architecturally combining dense wireless sensor networks with a suite of information technologies remotely accessible by the Internet. The architectural overview of the proposed Internet-enabled wireless structural monitoring system is presented including a description of its functional elements (for example, wireless sensors, database server, and application programming interfaces). The monitoring-system architecture proposed is validated on the New Carquinez (Alfred Zampa Memorial) Bridge in Vallejo, California. A permanent wireless monitoring system is installed consisting of 28 wireless sensor nodes collecting data from over 80 channels. The bridge sensor data are transferred by a wireless cellular connection to a remote database server where it is stored and available for interrogation by software clients granted access to the data. To illustrate the ability to autonomously process the bridge response data, the stochastic subspace identification method is used to extract accurate modal characteristics of the bridge that are used to update high-fidelity finite-element models of the bridge. The Internet-enabled wireless structural monitoring system proved to be scalable to a large number of nodes and has thus far proven stable and reliable over long-term use. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Application programming interfaces (API); Complex networks; Finite element method; Functional programming; Identification (control systems); Information management; Information technology; Internet; Modal analysis; Monitoring; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Stochastic models; Suspension bridges; Civil infrastructure systems; Complex infrastructures; Cyber infrastructures; Stochastic subspace identification methods; Structural monitoring; Wireless monitoring system; Wireless sensor; Wireless structural monitoring; Digital storage","Cyberinfrastructure; Modal analysis; Structural monitoring; Suspension bridge; System identification; Wireless sensors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84885009326"

This makes it possible for the driver to identify vehicles and pedestrians in the surrounding area, which was difficult with the existing overhead camera systems. The 360° wraparound view system has been developed by using graphics systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) for in-vehicle use (MB86R11/MB86R12). These SoCs combine ARM's Cortex™-A9, integrate an OpenGL ES2.0-compliant graphic engine and various peripheral interfaces on one chip, and achieve a low delay of 30 ms from camera image capture to composite image output and high image quality with a processing function to improve visibility. In addition, the middleware and authoring tools for creating and editing full-perimeter 3D monitoring images have realized a 360° seamless view around a vehicle.

This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful.

Developers also leverage location, presence, quality of service (QoS), and service negotiation APIs for their specific application.

Most of the commercially available software uses native file formats, which may not be able to be read or understood by other software. This paper deals with the development of a generic approach of a 3D model conversion program for virtual manufacturing (VM), using a lexical analyzer generator Lex and the Open Graphic Library (OpenGL). The program is able to convert 3D mesh data between four universal file formats, i.e.; Stereolithography (STL), Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and Object (OBJ). Simple assembly functions can be applied to the imported models. The quaternion angle is used for object rotation to overcome the problem of gimbal lock or a loss of one degree of rotational freedom. The program has been validated by importing the neutral format models into the program, applying the transformation, saving the new models with a new coordinate system, and lastly exporting into other commercial software. The results showed that the program is able to render and re-arrange accurately the geometry data from the different universal file formats and that it can be used in VM. Therefore, the output models from a VM system can be transferred or imported to another VM system in a universal file format. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.","Agile manufacturing systems; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer simulation languages; Digital libraries; Hypertext systems; Virtual reality; XML; Lex; Mesh data; Neutral format; OpenGL; Quaternion; Virtual manufacturing; Three dimensional","Lex; Neutral format; OpenGL; Quaternion; Three-dimensional mesh data; Virtual manufacturing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856254695"

Since the number of sigma-points grows proportionally to the number of degrees of freedom of the space-discretized structural system, the S-PKF can become computationally demanding.

For efficient Delaunay triangulation, points are first partitioned into cells, each of which is allocated roughly equal number of points. The cells can be naturally grouped into zones, in which Delaunay triangulation is constructed by simultaneous point insertion cell by cell within each zone. Delaunay triangles/tetrahedra at the boundary between zones can be created in parallel by adding layers of cells at the boundary of each zone to ensure circumcircles(circumspheres) of boundary triangles(tetrahedra) contain no points in their interior. Redundant triangles(tetrahedra) at the boundary between zones can be easily eliminated by individual processors in a completely independent manner by means of the elegant minimum vertex allocation scheme, such that a simplex with k vertices belonging to zones (z1, z2,... zk) is allocated to zone z=min (z1, z2,... zk). A two-dimensional version of the algorithm has been coded in Intel Fortran VS2010. The parallel zonal insertion on a PC can boost the speed of the single-processor insertion by 4.5 times for the insertion of 200 million randomly generated points in 65.7 s. The scalability of the parallel zonal insertion algorithm has also been tested on a proper multi-core machine with 12 processors running on OpenMP parallel directives with shared memory. Provided the number of zones is an integral multiple of the number of processors used, almost 100 scalability at 90 efficiency was observed for parallel insertion using 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 processors, and a 10.6 time speed up was recorded in a parallel insertion of 20 million points in 10×12=120 zones by 12 processors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li 4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, a Poisson equation needs to be solved at each time-step to project the velocity field onto a divergence-free space. Due to the non-local nature of its solution, this elliptic system is the part of the algorithm that is most difficult to parallelize. The Poisson solver presented here is restricted to problems with one uniform periodic direction. It is a combination of a block preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) and an FFT diagonalization. The latter decomposes the original system into a set of mutually independent 2D systems that are solved by means of the PCG algorithm. For the most ill-conditioned systems, that correspond to the lowest Fourier frequencies, the PCG is replaced by a direct Schur-complement based solver.The previous version of the Poisson solver was conceived for single-core (also dual-core) processors and therefore, the distributed memory model with message-passing interface (MPI) was used. The irruption of multi-core architectures motivated the use of a two-level hybrid MPI+OpenMP parallelization with the shared memory model on the second level. Advantages and implementation details for the additional OpenMP parallelization are presented and discussed in this paper. Numerical experiments show that, within its range of efficient scalability, the previous MPI-only parallelization is slightly outperformed by the MPI+OpenMP approach. But more importantly, the hybrid parallelization has allowed to significantly extend the range of efficient scalability. Here, the solver has been successfully tested up to 12800 CPU cores for meshes with up to 109 grid points. However, estimations based on the presented results show that this range can be potentially stretched up until 200,000 cores approximately. Finally, several examples of DNS simulations are briefly presented to illustrate some potential applications of the solver. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Conjugate gradient method; Direct numerical simulation; Fast Fourier transforms; Internet protocols; Memory architecture; Message passing; Scalability; Supercomputers; Velocity; 2-D systems; CPU cores; Diagonalizations; Distributed Memory; Divergence free; Dual-core; Elliptic system; Fourier; Grid points; Hybrid parallelization; Ill-conditioned systems; Message Passing Interface; Multicore architectures; Mutually independents; Nonlocal; Numerical experiments; OpenMP-parallelization; Original systems; Parallelizations; Poisson solvers; Potential applications; Preconditioned conjugate gradient; Schur complement; Second level; Shared memory model; Time step; Velocity field; Poisson equation","Direct numerical simulation; FFT; Hybrid parallelization MPI+OpenMP; Poisson solver; Preconditioned conjugate gradient; Schur complement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960893785"

Currently, this code is written mostly in assembly language and must be rewritten for each different hardware platform. For this reason, the development of media infrastructure is very expensive, time consuming for integration and programming. Therefore, the media infrastructure portability is a multi-level industry problem. The application programmers need a cross-platform portable API (Application Programming Interface) for controlling high-level media operations. The system integrators need cross-vendor standard for media component integration with sophisticated data routing and robust synchronization. The software component vendors and the silicon vendors need a reliable way to accelerate diverse codecs on diverse silicon. OpenMAX helps solve this industry problem. OpenMAX was founded to meet the need to accelerate the growth of multimedia platforms and therefore the creation of final products. The end result is a standardized set of open APIs for a variety of multimedia applications. OpenMAX define a royalty-free cross-platform API that standardizes access to multimedia processing primitives used extensively in video codecs such as MPEG-4, H.264/AVC, audio and image codecs and 2D and 3D graphics.

Although Open GL ES was started from the existing OpenGL features, it rapidly became the standard 3D graphics library customized for embedded systems through introducing fixed-point arithmetic operations, buffer management with fixed-point data type supports, completely new texture mapping functions and others. Currently, it is the official 3D graphics API for Google Android, Apple iPhone, Sony PlayStation3, etc. In this paper, we achieved improvements on the arithmetic operations for the fixed-point number representation, which is the most characteristic data type for OpenGL ES 1.1. For the conversion of fixedpoint data types to the floating-point number representations for the underlying OpenGL, we show the way of efficient conversion processes even with satisfying OpenGL ES standard requirements. We also introduced a specialized memory management scheme to manage the converted data from the buffer containing fixedpoint numbers. In the case of texture processing, the requirements in both standards are quite different, and thus we used completely new software-implementations. Our final implementation of OpenGL ES library provides all of more than 200 functions in the standard specification and passed its conformance test, to show its compliance with the standard.

Recent studies have revealed that one of the most critical components of a successful autonomous vehicle was the reliability of accurate positioning. Automatic vehicle location systems calculate real-time location of any vehicle equipped with a Global Positioning Satellite ""GPS"" receiver. Data are then transmitted to the transit center with use of radio or cellular communications and can be used immediately for daily operations as well as archived for further analysis. There exist a number of commercially available vehicle tracking application software packages which are usually delivered on the basis of a single license for each vehicle and in many cases do not meet the specific requirements of different users. The cost of the software component can be extremely high with increasing vehicle numbers. In this paper a stand-alone application is developed using GIS Map Window, an open source software ""OSS"" technology available free of charge from the internet and is customized using GIS Application Programming Interface ""API"", enabling building a product tailored to suit users exact needs.

The path of crack propagation for homogenous materials is straight trajectory while for heterogeneous materials is curved.

In this paper, we present the Event-Model-F, a formal model of events based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL).

It is developed following a pattern-oriented ontology design approach and can be easily extended by domain specific ontologies.

Our scheme is depth-based, relying on spatio-temporal analysis of the decoded video data to yield depth perception cues, such as temporal motion and spatial contrast, which reflect the relative depths between the foreground and the background areas. Our scheme is shot-adaptive, demanding that shot change detection and shot classification be performed for tuning of algorithm or parameters that are used for depth cue combination. The above-mentioned depth estimation is initially block-based, followed by a locally adaptive joint trilateral upsampling algorithm to reduce the computing load significantly. A recursive temporal filter is used to reduce the possible depth fluctuations (and also artifacts in the synthesized images) resulting from wrong depth estimations. The traditional Depth-Image-Based- Rendering algorithm is used to synthesize the left- and right-view frames for 3D display. Subjective tests show that videos converted by our scheme provide comparable perceived depth and visual quality with those converted from the depth data calculated by stereo vision techniques. Also, our scheme is shown to outperform the well-known TriDef software in terms of human's perceived 3D depth. Based on the implementation by using ""OpenMP"" parallel programming model, our scheme is capable of executing in real-time on a multi-core CPU platform. © 2012 Lin et al.; licensee Springer.","Application programming interfaces (API); Depth perception; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Stereo vision; Three dimensional; 3D perception; Depth cue; Depth Estimation; DIBR; Stereoscopic video; Algorithms","3D perception; Depth cue; Depth estimation; DIBR; Stereoscopic video conversion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887095965"

In particular, we propose a block-asynchronous computation strategy that maps the cellular automaton on the thread blocks of the GPU. This method reduces the number of points of global synchronization allowing efficient exploitation of the memory hierarchy of the GPU. We also avoid the artifacts produced in the watershed lines by the block-asynchronous updating scheme by correcting the data propagation speed among the blocks. The proposals are compared to an OpenMP multithreaded code. The high speedups indicate the potential of this kind of algorithm for new architectures based on hundreds of cores.

Many different approaches were developed over the years to address CFD applications. Good examples are finite volumes, finite differences (FD), and finite elements (FE) but also newer approaches such as the lattice-Boltzmann (LB), smooth particle hydrodynamics or the particle finite element method. FD and LB methods on regular grids are known to be superior in terms of raw computing speed, but using such regular discretization represents an important limitation in dealing with complex geometries. Here, we concentrate on unstructured approaches which are less common in the GPU world. We employ a nonstandard FE approach which leverages an optimized edge-based data structure allowing a highly parallel implementation. Such technique is applied to the 'convection-diffusion' problem, which is often considered as a first step towards CFD because of similarities to the nonconservative form of the Navier-Stokes equations. In this regard, an existing highly optimized parallel OpenMP solver is ported to graphics hardware based on the OpenCL platform. The optimizations performed are discussed in detail.

To make use of the entire processing power of a multi-core GPP and hence to avoid system inefficiency, this work provides an approach to parallelize C/C+∈+ code using OpenMP.

The objective of this study is to compare the performance of such hybrid programming models when applied to the simulation of a realistic physiological multiscale model of the heart. Our results show that the hybrid models perform favorably when compared to an implementation using only the MPI and, furthermore, that OpenMP in combination with the MPI provides a satisfactory compromise between performance and code complexity.

A semi-analytical harmonic coupled finite strip method (HCFSM) is used to solve the large deflection and the post-buckling problems or may be applied to both problems simultaneously. The stability of equilibrium states is assessed by looking at the eigenvalues of tangent stiffness matrix of structure. In the HCFSM formulation the coupling of all series terms dramatically increases computation time when a large number of series terms are used. Therefore it is natural to use parallel programming standards, such as MPI and OpenMP to speed up computation.

As data becomes publicly available, the development of effective visualization applications, from simple virtual sight-seeing also known as geo-browsers to more complex solutions combining data with smart services, has opened the door for new opportunities to improve the general quality of life. Applications such as personal navigators, virtual globes, social networking and mobile review portals are only a small example set. This field, until recently restricted to high-end workstations and personal computers, is rapidly expanding to mobile devices to ensure seamless access to geospatial information to be used on the go. For this reason, one of the new challenges has become the visualisation of such information within these smartphones and their combination with their advanced hardware and connectivity equipment in order to create innovative smart services to improve the quality of life. This work illustrates the research work which has led to a lightweight three dimensional framework for geospatial visualization, running on Android enabled devices and how this technology has been used for intelligent urban mobility in the context of a European project as an example of its potential. The system makes use of hardware acceleration, complies with several standards typical of the geospatial domain, is customizable through a layer-based architecture and is used as a basis for daily intelligent multimodal routing. After a brief overview of the protocols and technologies adopted, the paper presents the system, the results of an extended test phase, some practical example of how the framework can be customized for a real urban mobility scenario, the problems tackled and the limitations to be faced. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer architecture; Data visualization; Geographic information systems; Hardware; Location based services; Mobile devices; Personal computers; Robots; Software packages; Visualization; Complex solution; Customizable; European project; Geo-spatial; Geographical Information System; Geospatial information; Geospatial visualization; Hardware acceleration; Mobile 3D; Mobile GIS; Multi-modal; On The Go; Quality of life; Smart services; Three-dimensional frameworks; Urban mobility; Visualization application; Three dimensional computer graphics","3D mobile GIS; Android OS; OpenGL ES; Urban mobility","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868586268"

The optimization problem is formulated as minimizing the volume subject to displacement constraints. Nodal densities of the finite element mesh are used as the design variables. The nodal densities are interpolated into any point in the design domain by the Shepard interpolation scheme and the Heaviside function. Without using additional constraints (such as the filtering technique), mesh-independent, checkerboard-free, distinct optimal topology can be obtained. Adopting the rational approximation for material properties (RAMP), the topology optimization procedure is implemented using a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method and a dual programming optimization algorithm. The computational efficiency is greatly improved by multithread parallel computing with OpenMP to run parallel programs for the shared-memory model of parallel computation. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.","Application programming interfaces (API); Approximation algorithms; Computational efficiency; Interpolation; Mesh generation; Shape optimization; Topology; Interpolation schemes; Multiple constraint; Multiple load case; Nodal densities; Parallel Computation; Constrained optimization","Element independent nodal density; Multiple constraints; Multiple load cases; Parallel computation; Shepard interpolation scheme; Topology optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875411654"

Particularly, attackers can explore vulnerabilities of a cloud system and compromise virtual machines to deploy further large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). DDoS attacks usually involve early stage actions such as multistep exploitation, low-frequency vulnerability scanning, and compromising identified vulnerable virtual machines as zombies, and finally DDoS attacks through the compromised zombies. Within the cloud system, especially the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds, the detection of zombie exploration attacks is extremely difficult. This is because cloud users may install vulnerable applications on their virtual machines. To prevent vulnerable virtual machines from being compromised in the cloud, we propose a multiphase distributed vulnerability detection, measurement, and countermeasure selection mechanism called NICE, which is built on attack graph-based analytical models and reconfigurable virtual network-based countermeasures. The proposed framework leverages OpenFlow network programming APIs to build a monitor and control plane over distributed programmable virtual switches to significantly improve attack detection and mitigate attack consequences.

There are many factors which could influence the wafer shape. So in this paper based on the rotational coordinates method, a theoretical model of the ground wafer shape in wafer rotational grinding is firstly developed, in which the main factors were considered, including parameters of the dressing vacuum chuck and the wafer grinding, etc. Secondly, the simulation system was developed by Visual C++ and OpenGL according to the model, by which the simulation results of wafer shape could be made and the relationship between the wafer shape and parameters can be gotten. Finally, the experiments of wafer grinding were carried out on an ultra-precision grinder (VG401MKII), and the developed model is verified to be correct by comparing the experiment results and simulation results. The research indicates the wafer shape and flatness can be predicted exactly, and it is quite significant to choose the reasonable parameters to effectively control the wafer shape in the wafer rotational grinding.

The results show that the new implementation can be several times faster than the OpenMP version. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Application programming interfaces (API); Hardware; Navier Stokes equations; Optimal systems; Program processors; Edge-based; GPU; Navier Stokes; OpenCL; OpenMP; Unstructured grid; Optimization","Edge-based; GPU; Navier-Stokes; OpenCL; OpenMP; Unstructured grids","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878149363"

The spatial cylindrical joints with clearances are modeled by two rigid bodies, that is, the journal and bearing, where the difference in radius and axial directions defines the radial clearance and axial clearance, respectively. A new four-point contact kinematic model of NCF is proposed for the rigid cylindrical clearance joint. A combined control scheme consisting of a feedforward torque and a PID feedback controller is adopted to track the joint trajectories. Based on the principle of virtual work, a new and simple method is proposed to evaluate the feedforward torque. To improve computational efficiency, an OpenMP based parallel computational strategy is used to solve the large scale equations of motion.

FEFLO is a typical adaptive, edge-based finite element code for the solution of compressible and incompressible flows, which is primarily written in Fortran 77 and has previously been ported to vector, shared memory parallel and distributed memory parallel machines. Owing to the large size of FEFLO and the likelihood of human error in porting, as well as the desire for continued development within a single codebase, a specialized Python script, based on FParser (Int.

These pitfalls often cause very low efficiency, especially when many threads are employed. Through an in-depth investigation on these pitfalls with analysis and numerical experiments, we propose an efficient OpenMP parallel MLFMA. Two strategies are proposed in the parallelization, including: 1) loop reorganization for far-field interaction in the MLFMA; 2) determination of a transition level.
